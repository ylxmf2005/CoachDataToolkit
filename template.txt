Above is a raw psychological coaching video transcription.
Follow the 3 steps to complete your task:

Step1: 
Determine how many coaching sessions are present. 
A session starts when the interaction between the coach and coachee begins.
A session ends when:
- If there is no commentary or epilogue from the Marker, end at the formal conclusion of the coaching interaction.
- If there is a Markerâ€™s final commentary or epilogue after the coaching interaction, extend the end to include the Marker's final words.

For each session, detemine the start line number and end line number

Step2:
For each session identified in Step 1, analyze each speaker's role based on the following definitions:
- Coach
- Coachee
- Marker: A thrid-party (not coach/coachee themselves) speaker comments/evaluates the coaching process or just narrates, not part of direct interaction between coach and coachee. 
- Uninvolved: The speaker doesn't take part in this session / The speaker's role is unknown (can not be labeled as Coach/Coachee/Marker).

Step3:
Structure the output in JSON format as illustrated in the example below. Session index starts from 0.

Example output:

    "Session 1" : [start2, end2],
    "[SPEAKER_00]" : {{
        "Session 0" : "Coach",
        "Session 1" : "Marker"
    }}
    "[SPEAKER_01]" : {{
        "Session 0" : "Marker",
        "Session 1" : "Coach",
    }}
    
    "[SPEAKER_02]" : {{
        "Session 0" : "Coachee",
        "Session 1" : "Uninvolved"
    }}
    "[SPEAKER_03]" : {{
        "Session 0" : "Uninvolved",
        "Session 1" : "Coachee and Marker"
    }}
}}
