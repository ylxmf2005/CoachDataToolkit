Above is a raw psychological coaching video transcription.
Your task is to identify the following:
1. Coach Identification: Determine which speaker(s) are the coach.
2. Coachee Identification: Identify which speaker(s) are the coachee(s).
3. Marker Identification: Identify if there is a speaker commenting or evaluating the coaching process, not part of direct interaction between coach and coachee. Marker may be a thrid-party or coach himeself.
4. Session Identification: Determine how many coaching sessions are present. For each session, provide the duration using line numbers. Note that a session starts when the coach and coachee begin interacting directly (instead coach speaking alone), and ends with the formal conclusion of their interaction.

Use the JSON format to output finally, please reference the format of example. Before the finnal output, you are required to analyze the task comprehensively first.

A Speaker may have multiple roles, which should be represented as a list in the final output. If a speaker cannot be labeled as either "Coach," "Coachee," or "Marker," please label the speaker as "Unknown".

Example input:
1. [SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to our coaching session video series!
2. [SPEAKER_01]: Let's dive into our session now.
3. [SPEAKER_01]: What would you like to focus on today?
4. [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been feeling overwhelmed at work  I'm not sure how to balance my personal life with my job demands.
5. [SPEAKER_02]: Notice how the coachee is expressing a need for balance in their life.
6. [SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd be happier if I could just be more creative and play more often.
...
15. [SPEAKER_01]: Goodbye.
16. [SPEAKER_00]: Bye, thankyou for you coaching.
