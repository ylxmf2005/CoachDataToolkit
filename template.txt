Above is a raw psychological coaching video transcription.
Follow the 3 steps to complete your task:

Step1:
Concisely summarize the video transcription.

Step2: 
- A session starts when the coaching interaction between the coach and coachee begins, instead of the coach speeking alone or introduce the video.
- A session ends whe the coaching interaction and marker's comment (if present) between the coach and coachee officialy ends. 
The coach's summary, promotion, and conclusion of a video should not be included in the coaching session.

Carefully examine and determine how many coaching sessions are present based on the criteria.
For each session, detemine the start index number and end index number. 

Step3:
For each session identified in Step 1, analyze each speaker's role based on the following definitions:
- Coach
- Coachee
- Marker: A speaker who comments on or evaluates the coaching process.
- Uninvolved: The speaker doesn't take part in this session. 
- Others: Unknown speaker or speaker with no practical use.

Since this is a video transcription, a single person's voice might be recognized as two different speakers. If you notice a speaker whose behavior is similar to the coach or coachee, consider assigning them the appropriate role (coach/coachee) instead of labeling them as the marker.

Step4:
Structure the output in JSON format as illustrated in the example below. Session index starts from 0.

Think carefully about each step and provide detailed reasoning and analysis.
