71. Coach: And tell me about that building company.
72. Coachee: That building company was from age 40 to 49, we did 18 million in sales.
73. Coachee: And in 2008, when the economy fluctuated, you know, it was a good time to leave.
74. Coach: Yeah.
75. Coach: Was that a hard time?
76. Coachee: It was a real hard time.
77. Coachee: Yeah, I lost everything in 2008.
78. Coach: Yeah, it was hard being fired, but losing everything, it takes it to another level, I get it.
79. Coachee: Yeah, it was devastating.
80. Coachee: I remember decorating the backyard for my daughter's graduation, and they were towing vehicles out of my driveway.
81. Coach: I'm a dad, so I feel that one.
82. Coach: Just tell me back into your business, $18 million towards the end of it.
83. Coach: Four years in, what was business like?
84. Coachee: In the building company?
85. Coachee: Mm-hmm.
86. Coachee: Probably 400,000, half a million maybe.
87. Coachee: Yeah.
88. Coach: How did you feel back then?
89. Coach: Did it feel like we're a complete success or did it feel like we should be doing so much better?
90. Coachee: Oh, no, it never felt like a success.
91. Coachee: Yeah, it didn't matter where I got.
92. Coachee: Yeah.
93. Coachee: Yeah.
94. Coach: So what I'm hearing, if I'm right, is that one of the mindsets that helps you to succeed in life is if I don't feel like a success, then I have to take certain actions, do certain things, shop a certain way, and that leads to success.
95. Coachee: Yes.
96. Coach: And it works, right?
97. Coachee: Seems to, yeah.
