155. Coach: How are you?
156. Coach: Hi, Lorraine.
157. Coachee: Fantastic.
158. Coach: Oh, it's so good to be with you today.
159. Coachee: I'm pretty excited.
160. Coachee: Yeah.
161. Coach: All right.
162. Coach: So as Alison set up for us, we have 12 minutes together.
163. Coach: And as Rosa mentioned, a lot of magic can happen.
164. Coach: No pressure.
165. Coach: Whatever happens between us happens.
166. Coach: And I trust that that's what's right for you at this time.
167. Coach: So given our time together, what is your topic for today or what you're bringing to coaching?
168. Coachee: I have been thinking about this for quite some time.
169. Coachee: I would like to get better with my presence as a coach.
170. Coachee: because I feel like that's really important.
171. Coachee: I notice as I'm able to be more present, deep in my presence, I can better allow that space for clients.
172. Coach: Okay, so what's the top of mind for you is expanding your capacity for in-depth and coaching presence, that competency?
173. Coach: Yes.
174. Coach: And what's important to you about that is that when you do that for yourself, it allows you to do it for others.
175. Coachee: Yes.
176. Coach: Okay.
177. Coach: Is there anything else that's important in expanding your coaching presence that's meaningful or significant for you at this time?
178. Coachee: I think what I think about when you say that, Loray, is I've spent a lot of time inspiring people and wanting to be that source of inspiration.
179. Coachee: What I'm learning as I work to deepen my presence as a coach is it's more as being a conduit for them to experience that in themselves.
180. Coachee: Yes.
181. Coachee: And so that's what's important for me.
182. Coach: Wonderful, wonderful.
183. Coach: So given that coaching presence and expanding that so that you can allow, create more space for others to allow them to experience that sense of presence and be that conduit, what is it that you'd like to gain in our time together that you don't have now?
184. Coachee: Well, sometimes I realize in coaching, I might lean in too far.
185. Coach: Like I just did.
186. Coachee: But then I find myself leaning back.
187. Coachee: And so more in developing the presence, I want to just be right here with them.
188. Coach: So really meet.
189. Coach: And are you speaking in the physical realm?
190. Coach: Are you speaking in the holistic, just for context?
191. Coach: What does that mean to you to meet them where they are?
192. Coachee: To meet them where they are.
193. Coachee: I just...
194. Coachee: I think human beings are absolutely amazing.
195. Coachee: And I think it's sometimes I've been corrected to say, oh, you can't just go put a gold star on people's forehead, you know?
196. Coachee: And so how do we let them feel that within themselves?
197. Coachee: And how do I be a presence for that?
198. Coachee: Hmm.
199. Coach: Hmm.
200. Coach: Wow.
201. Coach: Okay.
202. Coach: So what I'm really hearing show up between us and this at this moment is that is really your incredible, your beliefs about people and how much potential actually exists within them and that you're extremely passionate.
203. Coach: This whole thing about presence for you and expanding your coaching presence really creates an opportunity for people to
204. Coach: to connect with that potential within themselves yes very much so so meeting people where they are then if that's what you're wanting to leave with how will you know that you've achieved that today with me um blind that achievement word is funny for me because I don't want it to be a reward um how will I know um
205. Coachee: Can you say that one more time?
206. Coachee: How will we know that we've achieved that today between the two of us or with a client?
207. Coach: If what you're wanting to leave this conversation with is a sense of what it means to meet your client where they are in your coaching presence, how will you know that you've achieved that within our coaching today?
208. Coachee: I would say connection.
209. Coachee: Let down my guard.
210. Coachee: really set aside what the world thinks and what others think and just really be dialed in on their heart what's really meaningful to them ah maybe that's helpful like more set aside what's meaningful to me but focus on what's more meaningful to them okay you just had a oh moment what did you connect with there
211. Coachee: Maybe, and I feel it a little bit too, because I've always been such an inspiration.
212. Coachee: It's like, it's the meaning that they want.
213. Coachee: And if I'm opening to my presence for the meaning that they want, not the meaning I want or see for them to be inspired, but what's meaningful for them, that will create that connection.
214. Coach: wow so what's really important about this moment what this this awareness that's emerged about opening up to what's meaningful to them wow I mean connection is so huge in coaching allowing people to be seen and heard just for who they are and just for like
215. Coachee: where they are right in front of me, not where I see them in the future or not where it's like right here, right now.
216. Coach: There's a quote that comes to mind as I hear you speak, and you may have heard it.
217. Coach: It's by Elizabeth Gilbert.
218. Coach: To be seen, fully seen and loved anyway is a human offering that borders on miraculous.
219. Coach: It just seems to sum you up and where you are in this moment.
220. Coachee: Yeah.
221. Coach: Yeah.
222. Coach: yeah okay that's powerful all right so where where does that where do you where do you what are you connecting with at this moment that you that that will support you in expanding your presence that's a great question it's almost like my heart and my gut but it's almost like inner knowing too that sometimes we cover this up and as
223. Coachee: is I can let that open up in me.
224. Coachee: I feel like it can be more available for other people.
225. Coach: Okay.
226. Coach: And just to be really clear, you say, when I cover this up, what is this that you're referring to when I cover this up?
227. Coachee: I think fully expressing myself as a leader.
228. Coachee: Yeah.
229. Coachee: Yeah.
230. Coachee: I think, um,
231. Coachee: I've been hiding behind a lot of shoulds or how do we correctly do it for people or how do we exactly make it happen instead of like just fully expressing myself.
232. Coach: So in the time, so you've just recognized and you've just liberated, okay.
233. Coach: Okay, so what's this?
234. Coach: What's now possible that wasn't before?
235. Coachee: I'm feeling liberated.
236. Coachee: It's not so much designing the presence, but it's being liberated in who I am and who I want to be for the person across from me.
237. Coachee: Yeah.
238. Coach: So I had this sense when you came in that around coaching presence, it was something that you felt you needed to do.
239. Coach: Yes.
240. Coach: What changed?
241. Coachee: I hate that doing an achievement thing, right?
242. Coachee: I don't want to measure up.
243. Coachee: I just want to be.
244. Coachee: And I think as we can allow other people be, and I give myself that own permission, then you allow that permission to flourish in other people.
245. Coach: Oh, wow.
246. Coach: Wow.
247. Coach: Wow.
248. Coach: So, so, so the being giving to yourself is,
249. Coach: Let me go back to your word.
250. Coach: Liberating yourself in this space and giving yourself permission to be fully expressed, fully seen, fully human in all your beauty and perfect imperfection actually is the path to expanding your coaching presence is where you're at right now because in that you're giving permission and you're creating space in the environment for others to do the same.
251. Coachee: Mm-hmm.
252. Coachee: Yes, and that makes me think about joy.
253. Coachee: There's so much joy that we miss and fully expressing me is bringing way more joy.
254. Coachee: Yeah.
255. Coachee: Presence, joy, peace.
256. Coachee: Yeah.
257. Coach: You just put a star on your own forehead.
258. Coachee: Oh my goodness.
259. Coachee: Yeah.
260. Coachee: So no more hiding, Loray.
261. Coach: Okay, I hear you.
262. Coach: I hear you.
263. Coach: So what does that mean as far as what's different as a, you've made this contact, you've liberated yourself in this beautiful, in these beautiful moments.
264. Coach: What does that mean?
265. Coach: And how does it translate into action?
266. Coach: I guess is what I'm wondering about.
267. Coachee: Well, I think we talked a few seconds ago or a few minutes ago about where is it, the heart, the gut, but fully expressing to me seems like
268. Coachee: expanse of the heart, you know, not be, you know, not be afraid of what might happen in there, but just still be in the presence.
269. Coach: Okay.
270. Coach: So you're doing this when you see me do this, what does that mean to you?
271. Coachee: Liberation of the heart.
272. Coach: Okay.
273. Coach: Okay.
274. Coach: And what does that, what does that, how does that translate to
275. Coach: as you leave this conversation into your life, how do you cultivate and nurture this expansion of your heart?
276. Coachee: Well, to be a dynamic leader and a coach, you've got to open your heart.
277. Coachee: You've got to expand the heart.
278. Coach: May I pause you for a moment?
279. Coach: Can you go back and just language that as an I statement, please?
280. Coachee: As I step out as a dynamic leader, I have to be willing to open the expanse of my heart to be present for other people.
281. Coach: Okay, how did that land when you said it, when you owned your language?
282. Coachee: Yeah, a little nervous, but you know what?
283. Coachee: A little like, why not?
284. Coachee: What else are we here for?
285. Coachee: Yeah.
286. Coach: Hey, so that's the edge.
287. Coach: You touched an edge.
288. Coach: There's a little like, oh, so...
289. Coach: What in that space of what are we here for?
290. Coach: You're ready for this.
291. Coach: It emerged so beautifully and organically in our conversation.
292. Coach: You're ready.
293. Coach: What is it that you need to continue to move this forward and nurture this as a leader, as a person, as a coach?
294. Coachee: To believe in my own heart.
295. Coachee: I've got to believe in that first.
296. Coachee: And believing in that will...
297. Coach: make me more present okay and willing to be with other people in that way yeah I feel that little edge yeah all right yeah so given that our time is up and in honoring the space for other people to be coached is there anything that you feel compelled or feel the desire to do
298. Coach: to support you in opening your heart, trusting your heart, believing in your own heart and being.
299. Coachee: I think it's totally okay to continue to inspire people because that's really a belief I have and energizes my own heart.
300. Coachee: But to know in coaching, I want to have it be about them finding that in themselves.
301. Coach: And that it starts with you.
302. Coachee: Yes, absolutely.
303. Coachee: Absolutely.
304. Coach: Beautiful.
305. Coach: Thank you so much.
306. Coachee: Thanks, Loray.
307. Coach: Thank you so much for playing with me in that space and liberating yourself in this beautiful, important, important way.
308. Coachee: I kind of forgot about everybody in the room, but thank you for being here.
309. Coachee: That's great.
310. Coach: Well, that in itself was coaching presence.
