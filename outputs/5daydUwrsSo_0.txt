9. Coach: So Brighton, it's good to see you again.
10. Coachee: It is so good to see you too, Jennifer.
11. Coach: Where are you these days?
12. Coachee: So currently I am in Portland, Oregon.
13. Coachee: So it's a little... Well, actually there is some sun behind me, which is surprising.
14. Coach: Yeah.
15. Coach: So, and you've been traveling.
16. Coachee: Yes.
17. Coachee: Yeah.
18. Coachee: I spent the last five months down in Mexico at our home down there.
19. Coach: Yeah.
20. Coachee: Yeah.
21. Coachee: So it's a little bit...
22. Coachee: Yeah.
23. Coachee: I'm back here in Oregon a little early, I think.
24. Coach: Yeah.
25. Coach: I just got back from Mexico, too, and I thought of you.
26. Coach: And anyway, well, here we are.
27. Coach: And you told me you haven't been coached before with all the people you work with.
28. Coachee: Yes.
29. Coachee: I have never been coached before, and I only know that because I've been with enough coaches to know what coaching is.
30. Coachee: I have hired coaches before, but gotten consultants, which have been wonderful consultants, but they weren't coaches.
31. Coachee: They might have been coaches, but they weren't coaching.
32. [SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
33. Coachee: So I'm looking for some real coaching coaching.
34. Coach: Well, you'll get to have a little bit of that today because that's what I do.
35. Coachee: Perfect.
36. Coach: We have about 2530 minutes or so together right and you and I have never really worked in this capacity before.
37. Coach: Correct.
38. Coach: What's important for me to know about you that makes things comfortable and easy to sort of explore together with someone you haven't worked with before.
39. Coachee: I don't know, I feel like we've worked together, just not in a coachee coaching.
40. Coach: I know, you're usually telling me what to do.
41. Coachee: Yes, exactly.
42. Coachee: So yeah, I am a pretty comfortable guy.
43. Coachee: So I feel like, you know, you don't have to hold any punches or anything like that.
44. Coachee: So we'll just...
45. Coach: I heard that you know at least what the distinction is between a consultant and a coach.
46. Coach: Yes.
47. Coachee: Yes.
48. Coach: All right.
49. Coach: Anything else you need to be here now and ready to dive in?
50. Coachee: I'm just going to proclaim my nervousness.
51. Coachee: But yeah, let's make it happen.
52. Coach: So do you mind taking a deep breath with me?
53. Coach: And maybe we'll just diffuse some of that.
54. Coach: How about it?
55. Coachee: Sounds good.
56. Marker: I'd like to draw attention to the fact that though Jennifer and Brighton had not worked together before as coach and client, they had worked together before.
57. Marker: And so Jennifer spent the time simply getting into relationship with one another.
58. Marker: knowing that they were going to focus in a new way.
59. Marker: So there was a little bit of chit-chat and then a little bit more focus toward the coaching and then really settling in on now we're going to be working together and we're going to be doing something over the next 20 to 30 minutes.
60. Marker: When Brighton claimed his nervousness, then Jennifer took the opportunity to suggest that they do something to bring that energy down.
61. Marker: And when she chose to, let's just take a couple of breaths and ask if he was willing to do that, and he was.
62. Marker: Another way that she could have done it might have been to just say, what would help calm those nerves or help you to be comfortable in getting started together in this way?
63. Marker: Either way worked really well.
64. Marker: One's a little more open.
65. Coach: Ah.
66. Coach: So in this little bit of time we have together, you know, what, what is it that it's on your mind or something that you'd like to explore?
67. Coachee: And, and I think this was the hardest part for me with preparing was like, what am I supposed to talk about?
68. Coachee: Um, and I think what I came up with was, um,
69. Coachee: let's find all those hours and minutes in the day that I keep losing.
70. Coachee: Because I seem to get to the end of the day and I'm like, my wife and I have a similar problem.
71. Coachee: And we say like, how is it possible that people have children when we have no children and still we're, you know, we don't have any extra time.
72. Coachee: Like how would someone fit a child into a life if this is our life?
73. Coachee: I'm trying to figure out where those minutes go.
74. Coachee: And I think this is also kind of related to productivity, procrastination, and stuff like that.
75. Marker: So you heard about four or five different possible themes that Brighton spoke to as he was jumping in.
76. Marker: it would be very tempting for a coach to simply grab onto that procrastination and productivity and roll with it.
77. Marker: Watch what Jennifer does instead.
78. Marker: She really takes her time and she has a lot of patience for helping Brighton really get clear about what would be useful for him and what they might do together.
79. Coach: If you actually did have more time,
80. Coach: in your day, how would you be using it?
81. [SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting question.
82. Coachee: I'd hate to say that I'd be working more, but I do enjoy my work.
83. Coachee: I'm wondering if my question or my proposal here isn't quite right.
84. Coachee: Maybe it's not that I need more minutes that I need to spend, that I need to feel better about the way I'm spending.
85. Coachee: Yeah.
86. Coach: Yeah.
87. Coach: So something about the way things are right now, isn't sitting quite right with you in this moment in time.
88. Coach: Right.
89. Coach: Put a finger on what that experience is, how you're feeling it.
90. Coachee: Um,
91. Coachee: I think it's partly just finding myself and actually you got to witness a little bit of this.
92. Coachee: I think it was yesterday when I sent the email and it was, I think, two hours had passed between the point where I started writing the email when I stopped.
93. Coachee: And, you know, I was at a coffee shop and I'd just done, you know, all these different things and kept intending to do one thing.
94. Coachee: But I was like, oh, you know, I need to â€“
95. Coachee: do x y or z and so a lot of just shifting gears and being maybe inefficient with time um distracted and not necessarily doing the thing that would be the best use of my time
96. Marker: So you'll notice he was bringing up, I want to feel better about the way I use my time.
97. Marker: And then he gave an illustration.
98. Marker: And Jennifer rested with that.
99. Marker: Again, she could have grabbed it and gone into analytics about how would you use your time?
100. Marker: But instead, she brought it back to him in terms of the quality, the piece that he was looking for about feeling better.
101. Marker: Watch what happens.
102. Coach: How are you determining what the best use of your time is?
103. Coachee: Perhaps it's a lack of guilty feeling.
104. Coachee: Like, I usually get that.
105. Coachee: I'm like, oh, I can't believe I just went down that rabbit hole.
106. Coachee: I, you know, that was not the best use of my time.
107. Coachee: Like, I feel like I don't have a huge clarity anymore.
108. Coachee: my business it might be good to understand my business just a little bit so i have um projects where i do videos for clients some of them ongoing clients um i also have a lot of affiliate revenue where i'm making videos about products and um you know that's all fun and it's actually making you know a big chunk of my income right now and then on my youtube channel about moving to mexico which is going to be my
109. Coachee: my future revenue.
110. Coachee: And so a lot of times I'm in the wrong, not the wrong, but I'm in a spot where I'm like, oh, you know,
111. Coachee: should I really be doing this Amazon thing?
112. Coachee: Like when I was supposed to be finishing the email to you, I got stuck somehow on an Amazon, like, you know, I read an article that said, you can look at the bestsellers and those are good, good videos to make.
113. Coachee: And so I was going through it all of a sudden I was like, oh my God, I've just gone down this huge rabbit hole of looking at bestsellers on Amazon, trying to determine which one I can make money off of.
114. Coachee: And that did not feel like a good use of my time, for instance.
115. [SPEAKER_07]: It served some purpose.
116. Coachee: Yeah.
117. Coach: So what's the guilt?
118. Coach: What's the guilt?
119. Coachee: I think that's the guilt.
120. Coachee: The purpose was to help me identify what I shouldn't have been doing at that point in time.
121. Coach: Yeah, so it occurs to me there's lots of things going on right now.
122. Coach: There's a couple inner voices.
123. Coach: I'm hearing a couple different things.
124. Coach: You know, that you're telling yourself sort of a story around this.
125. Coach: But there's something that's not settled in you about this kind of, it sounds like, ongoing behavior.
126. [SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
127. [SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.
128. Coach: So in our time together, what would a successful shift look like?
129. Marker: All during this time, Jennifer has been helping Brighton to settle on what is important to him, what he thinks he's wanting to work with, and then she finally
130. Marker: After listening for what were around eight-ish minutes, nine minutes, then she focuses in on, so what is it that you really are wanting?
131. Marker: At this point, she's gotten a lot of meaning.
132. Marker: She's gotten a lot of story.
133. Marker: But now, what's the outcome?
134. Marker: What are we really looking for here?
135. Marker: She gave him a lot of space for reflection.
136. Marker: Probably a client you've worked with for a long time, you might not need to have that much story.
137. Marker: But in this beginning session, in this giving space for the client to find his way into what it feels like to be coached, it's really a useful strategy.
138. Marker: And so let's find out, what is he really looking for?
139. Coachee: Boy, I'm struggling here.
140. Coachee: I don't want to say it's to get rid of that guilty feeling because the guilty feeling is there for probably a good reason.
141. Coachee: I mean, and I'm not sure we can in this half hour, you know, solve my productivity issues.
142. [SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, what...
143. Coachee: How do I, as a new coachee, how do I even determine that?
144. Coach: So if you really look at how you're feeling right now and how you were feeling yesterday when you noticed two and a half hours had gone by or whatever, what is the experience you're having?
145. Coachee: Yeah.
146. Coachee: I mean, guilt's the only word that I can come up with.
147. Coachee: And maybe it's not even guilt.
148. Coachee: Maybe it's more shame to be like, oh, you know, that was dumb of me to have spent my time doing that versus any other thing I could have been doing.
149. Marker: So notice Brighton asked a clear question about how do I know as a new client?
150. Marker: And Jennifer did not answer him by giving him ways to know.
151. Marker: She simply asked a question about what he was experiencing and how he was receiving the messages he was getting from his own system.
152. Marker: But here's what's really fun.
153. Marker: Watch what's coming up now.
154. Coach: So there was some self-criticism going on there.
155. Coach: It's sort of a critical voice that
156. Coach: yeah yeah something that made you feel off right i mean you could have said oh two and a half hours went by and i learned a whole bunch of stuff now i better get back to my email you didn't say that yeah yeah so i
157. Marker: probably was a little premature there, but, but notice the possibility that existed in that moment where she pointed out the validity of validity of what was going on for him and also what could have happened instead.
158. Marker: And her next question.
159. Coach: So what, what do you think is really, what's, what's really underneath all this?
160. Coachee: Now,
161. Coachee: Now I'm thinking of spending time with my therapist and my father to not waste time and get stuff done.
162. [SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
163. Coachee: Midwestern roots of, you know, get it done.
164. [SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
165. Coachee: Don't play.
166. Coachee: Don't mess around.
167. Coachee: Word comes first.
168. Coachee: So all that's swirling in there.
169. Coach: So when you hear kind of that influence, those voices of influence, how's that sit with you right now?
170. [SPEAKER_07]: I feel like...
171. Coachee: You know, it's interesting.
172. Coachee: I just saw the other day I was unpacking everything and I came across this little button that said play.
173. Coachee: And that's all it said.
174. Coachee: And I remembered where I got it was at actually an ICF event, I believe, where they were doing an ICF Oregon event where they were doing improv training, which is very playful.
175. Coachee: And I think that's maybe where I'm going is that that missing part of
176. Coachee: that we talked about earlier is play.
177. Coachee: And instead of getting my work done to then go play, I am interspersing distraction into the middle of my work so that my workday ends at 11 PM.
178. Marker: Now we have a direction where it's a diversion from what he started with.
179. Marker: And
180. Marker: They've been going along exploring his relationship to how he feels about the way he's spending his time.
181. Marker: And now we've got an entirely new element.
182. Marker: there really isn't a fully formed agreement about what they're going to do together, but there's a vast terrain.
183. Marker: And what Jennifer is doing is following Brighton's lead and helping him explore the pieces, perhaps without as much direction as we would normally expect in a session where Brighton and Jennifer had been working together over time.
184. Marker: It's not a perfect, do we know where we're going?
185. Marker: Do we know what the outcome will be?
186. Marker: And do we know what the success measures will be?
187. Marker: But it's an effective way to be building relationship amongst the two of them in this beginning coaching session.
188. Marker: So let's continue.
189. Coach: Yeah, and that, I hear that.
190. Coach: And so then that distraction, is that,
191. Coach: a version of play or what exactly is going on when that happens?
192. [SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe it is a little... It's... It's very... What's the word?
193. Coachee: Very not fun play.
194. Coachee: But it's not necessarily work.
195. Coachee: I mean, it might be reading CNN.com or something is another place where I find myself very distracted.
196. Coachee: So I don't know if they're habits.
197. Coach: What's important about play to you?
198. Coachee: I think just the idea that life is short.
199. Coach: play is is an important aspect of enjoyment of life so what's occurring to me right now as i'm kind of hearing you talk through this is um you lit up actually when you were talking about playing getting that little button um there was an energy about you that i experienced from you a lot when when you're doing your video work and when you're recording about your
200. Coach: mexico you know it's different than when you were talking about what sounded like to me the shoulds and this is you know so it what's occurring to me is there's an external influence going on do you feel something like that i feel like i've
201. Coachee: 49.9 years old, I think I've internalized all that external influence of my father and whatnot.
202. Coachee: So it's built in pretty well.
203. Coach: It's built in pretty well.
204. Coach: And that's what you've taken on.
205. Coach: When you hear yourself really wanting more of,
206. Marker: So here we are about halfway through the session, and the question is really emerging.
207. Marker: based on what Brighton has been experiencing, what his internalized experience has been, the impact of the Midwestern work ethic and the habits that he's developed.
208. Marker: And at this juncture, Jennifer's inviting him to really claim what it is that he wants so that that becomes the piece that they work on through the end of the session.
209. Marker: Notice also how together their humor swims through the session so that there's some lightness to it, even though they're exploring some aspects that could be awfully heavy to brighten.
210. Marker: But because of the lightness and because of the way that their relationship flows, he's able to take a look at it and not get mired in it and still be available for what else might be there.
211. Coachee: Let's continue.
212. Coachee: Joy.
213. Coachee: I was going to say fun, but it's not necessarily that, but it's joy.
214. Coachee: It's that...
215. Coachee: smile on your face, the feeling, the warmth inside.
216. [SPEAKER_07]: More of that.
217. [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
218. Coach: And how do you know when you're in that state of being?
219. Marker: Who asks a question like that?
220. Marker: Only a coach.
221. Marker: Let's keep going.
222. Coachee: I mean, that's a hard one because I don't think it's not obvious once you're inside it.
223. Coachee: It's usually something you look back on to say or something that I look back on to say, oh, God, that was so much fun.
224. Coachee: That dinner or whatever, we're out, we're laughing.
225. Coachee: We were really just having a good time.
226. Coach: And when those times are recalled, it brings up a feeling in you.
227. [SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.
228. Coach: That is, can you identify that?
229. Coachee: I feel, I mean, it's strange.
230. Coachee: I feel like I'm wanting to smile.
231. Coachee: It's like in my cheeks.
232. Coachee: You know, remembering the fun times.
233. Coachee: That's great.
234. Coach: All right, so...
235. Coach: As far as what I'm hearing you say is that it would be that there's something that you would like to understand a little bit better that would have you making choices that are a little different than you making them.
236. Coach: Yeah.
237. Coach: Yeah.
238. Marker: Yes.
239. Marker: So notice how she brings it all the way back.
240. Marker: So now we are to a new place of establishing the agreement.
241. Marker: considering all of the things that have had meaning for Brighton and that from here they can go forward to a little deeper exploration and then moving into what he will do moving forward with what he's discovered.
242. Marker: So we've always been exploring the meaning and
243. Marker: And now there's much more of a commitment of, yes, so this is what I want from the session.
244. Coach: And what do you suspect is a culprit to some of this lack of production in your eyes or maybe someone else's eyes?
245. Coach: Or that procrastination?
246. Coachee: And it may get down to... I mean, this might be kind of like an organized... Having something that I need to look forward to.
247. Coachee: You know, to say like, okay, that time is...
248. Coachee: We have a roommate right now.
249. Coachee: He rented our house while we were gone and we have a little one month overlap.
250. Coachee: And he was out last night playing softball.
251. Coachee: And I was like, oh yeah, that was fun back in the days.
252. Coachee: He's younger than us.
253. Coachee: We would play kickball and things like that.
254. Coachee: And so there was like that organized time and it was like they had to get to that, get there.
255. Coachee: It was on the agenda.
256. Coachee: and had to get everything done in order to get to that point.
257. Coach: Okay, so noticing that there's time carved out for that.
258. [SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
259. Coach: And what do you see in that for yourself?
260. Coachee: So two things, I mean, clearly the need to carve time, but then the need to put something in that, have something to put there.
261. Coachee: Cause a lot of the stuff, I mean, my work is fun.
262. Coachee: It's my business.
263. Coachee: It's my, and I'm like, you know what?
264. Coachee: I'm going to edit a video about taking a tour of La Paz and that's fun.
265. Coachee: So yeah,
266. Coachee: Yeah, I mean, it's a kind of a, what did Sarah call it?
267. Coachee: Not a work-life balance, but a work-life harmony or something like that.
268. Coach: Yeah, it's like you're weaving your fun and playfulness into a lot of the work you're doing.
269. Coach: But that missing piece, it's almost like that type of play that you're talking about or that space that you're wanting.
270. Coach: What is it for?
271. Coachee: It's, I think, where the joy comes in.
272. Coach: Okay, so that's slightly different in flavor.
273. Coachee: Yeah.
274. Coachee: Then, you know, it's fun and whatnot to make videos, but it's actually joyful.
275. [SPEAKER_07]: How is that different for you?
276. Coachee: I think interaction is important.
277. Coachee: Okay.
278. Coachee: It's hard to be joyful on your own.
279. Marker: There's a little bit of a challenge.
280. Marker: And that was just a spontaneous blurt on Jennifer's behalf.
281. Marker: But it turns into a little bit of a challenge of Brighton's thinking as well.
282. Marker: Could have been disruptive.
283. Marker: It isn't, he holds his space and continues.
284. Marker: But in this portion of the session, as we're listening into it, Jennifer ends up doing a lot more of the talking, the speaking than Brighton does for the next several interchanges.
285. Marker: And this is one of those places where
286. Marker: It's challenging as a coach to do we make the connections or do we have the client make the connections or how is it that we partner so that the client is really attending and internalizing to what they're working with as opposed to our sort of putting ideas in their head or moving in the direction that the coach sees makes sense.
287. Marker: So this is a place that I'm offering you to consider.
288. Marker: How does it land for you?
289. Marker: What suggestions might you make if you were making a suggestion to the coach?
290. Marker: Where do you see that it might have been useful that a question would have served better than a reflection?
291. Marker: Just notice, there's not a wrong way here.
292. Marker: It's simply where are some choice points that might have served in a different way?
293. Marker: let's go back to the session.
294. Coachee: Maybe if you're in some, uh, very, uh, inspirational areas, maybe it's a little easier, but I think joy is, is easier experienced.
295. Coach: I'm hearing a value around sharing.
296. Coachee: Yeah.
297. Coach: Sharing, enjoying it with others.
298. [SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
299. [SPEAKER_07]: Um,
300. Coachee: yeah, that there needs to be something, it needs to be planned out, that I need to create joy.
301. Coachee: And that kind of like, that reminds me of the play, you know, like playing, doing the improv stuff was joyful.
302. Coachee: It was, you know, interactive with other people.
303. [SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
304. Coach: So,
305. Coach: It feels like there's some incentive here to actually put some attention on how will you bring more of that in for yourself?
306. Coach: As I asked you that, I had this thought like, well, then back to the very beginning when you said finding time, finding
307. Marker: minutes but I think so we'll do that as coaches and again it's not about making it wrong it's noticing was that useful or wasn't it it was a connection that Jennifer made oh yeah we talked about this at the beginning was it necessary for her to bring that forward or was that something that if she had just waited Brighton would have brought for himself we don't know but let's see what happens
308. Coachee: But I think what I have is that, like, if there was something to fill the time, it'd be a lot easier for me to, in my head, say, oh, no, this is, you know, don't do that.
309. Coachee: We're going to do something better later.
310. Coachee: So there's going to be something more joyful that's coming up.
311. Coachee: So get your work done.
312. Coach: Yeah.
313. Coach: So I'm hearing that voice again.
314. Coach: Ask master voice.
315. Coach: It's like, but you did say, I want to look forward to something.
316. Coach: It needs to be.
317. [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
318. Coach: It needs to be in place.
319. Coach: It needs to make sense to you.
320. Coach: So that you can.
321. [SPEAKER_07]: What?
322. [SPEAKER_07]: So that I can.
323. Coachee: So I've got, let's say my kickball, my everyday quick kickball league or something that's happening every night at 8 PM.
324. Coachee: It not only, it puts in a spot for joy, but I think it also helps on the other end of, of being smart about my productivity and being purposeful because it's,
325. Coachee: I mean, I'm really good at completing projects by the deadline.
326. Coachee: But if there's not a deadline, I'm not so good at it.
327. Coachee: So I think this essentially the joy time is the deadline.
328. Coachee: And I'm happy when I'm productive.
329. Coachee: I mean, it's a good thing.
330. Coachee: And I get rid of the little guilty voice.
331. Coachee: So it's almost...
332. Coachee: a double win is to stay productive, stay on task.
333. Coachee: So I'm not like, I mean, today there's so much negative stuff in the world that you can get sucked into and I get sucked into some of that.
334. Coachee: So there's many wins there.
335. Coach: Wow.
336. Coach: How are you with prioritizing yourself in this way?
337. Marker: So we're moving into the segment of coaching, which is about synthesizing the learning and stepping towards the action.
338. Marker: And Jennifer's asking an important question that supports Brighton to consider accountability.
339. Marker: How are you about supporting or prioritizing yourself in that way?
340. Coachee: You know, I'm not quite sure.
341. Coachee: how to answer that because, because my, myself and my business are so tied in together.
342. Coachee: So it's not clear what's separate.
343. Coach: So in the conversation so far, check in with you, what have, what has been uncovered or what has shown itself here in our conversation that feels important to you?
344. Coachee: think it's the need for the intentionality of adding joy and
345. Coachee: and coming up with a way to make it happen.
346. Coachee: Um, you know, if that's more going out with friends, if that's more, you know, scheduling time with my wife, if it's more kind of that stuff, um, that seems to be easy to let go, um, or to have that time and then to fill it with something like, Oh, we need to plan that trip to Wisconsin and you know, that kind of thing.
347. Coachee: So, um,
348. Coach: So what needs to be different in the way you approach this so that you can actually give it a good try to see what might be different?
349. Marker: Hear the call to action.
350. Marker: Let's see what he does.
351. [SPEAKER_07]: That is a great question.
352. Coachee: And I struggle around the whole like, what is the joy and how to find it?
353. Coachee: And what are the steps I need to take to find it?
354. Coachee: I mean, commitment, obviously, now that I've kind of uncovered what is missing, at least now I know what to look for.
355. Coachee: But yeah, now kind of in terms of concrete steps,
356. [SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, besides intentionality.
357. [SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.
358. Coach: You know, a question's popping up for me.
359. Coach: Maybe something that you could be asking yourself on a regular basis.
360. Coach: It's like, when does joy show up for me?
361. Coach: That's what a pat answer, or maybe can you think of a question that's even a better one to ask yourself to keep you noodling on this?
362. [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
363. Marker: So as you recall from your coach training, Jennifer is presenting the possibility of an inquiry.
364. Marker: It appears that there's that Brighton doesn't have enough attachment to that new picture that he has, but he wants to think about it and he wants to connect to it.
365. Marker: So by inviting a question he thinks about over time, he has the ability to to further this dialogue without his co-chair.
366. Marker: And you'll notice that Jennifer.
367. Marker: had the sense that there is a question there and she worded a possibility, but turned it back to him in order for him to be able to find the words or the practice that fits for him.
368. Coachee: Yeah, it's almost like a bedtime practice of like, instead of a gratitude journal, a joy journal.
369. Coachee: Did I get to experience that today?
370. Coachee: What were those things?
371. Coachee: And I think one of the things about a gratitude journal is, of course, there's always something you should be grateful for.
372. Coachee: But if we're looking for joy, it may or may not have happened that day.
373. Coachee: And that's okay.
374. Coachee: But I think it's a good way to gauge it.
375. Coach: To gauge it and to notice what's already there.
376. Coach: Because a minute ago you said to go out and seek it.
377. Coach: And yet what I'm hearing is maybe raising the awareness a little bit on when does it show up?
378. Coach: Where does it show up?
379. Coach: Right.
380. Coach: Shows up more than I'm giving it credit for.
381. [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
382. Coach: Or maybe it's really missing.
383. [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
384. [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
385. [SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
386. Coach: That feels like a doable thing for you.
387. Coach: Does that feel like something that you could actually gift yourself with a commitment around?
388. Coachee: Yeah, I feel that is.
389. Coachee: That is something...
390. Coachee: Yeah.
391. Coachee: I felt like trying to commit to finding that everyday kickball league was too much.
392. Coachee: But finding where it is in my life now and better understanding that so that I can create more of it is much more achievable.
393. Coach: It's shifted for me in your demeanor.
394. Coach: What happened as you sort of downsized that potential?
395. Coachee: It seems possible.
396. Coach: Yeah.
397. Marker: So notice how Jennifer helped Brighton integrate the fact that he had had that feeling and that he hadn't really told her, but he would have been kind of holding his breath about it.
398. Marker: Am I really going to get into this in this way?
399. Marker: And by her simply checking, is it doable?
400. Marker: Is that something that you think that you would follow through on?
401. Marker: Gave him a chance to really weigh the options and choose towards what seemed like a right size step to really keep him in the consciousness of this search for joy.
402. Coach: Does it stretch you enough?
403. Marker: And we're on the other side of it.
404. Coachee: If I truly commit to it, yes.
405. Coach: Will you truly commit to it?
406. Coachee: Yes.
407. Marker: So that you can learn more about it, yeah.
408. [SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
409. Marker: Did you notice that powerful request?
410. Marker: Will you fully commit to it so that you can learn more?
411. Coach: Is there any other thing that you can imagine will support you as your...
412. Coach: really exploring what joy means to you, but also that piece about considering carving out some time for yourself so you have something to look forward to.
413. Coachee: I feel like once I've found the joy, that carving the time out won't be difficult.
414. Coach: Ah, so besides the multiple wins that already exist in that scenario that you painted.
415. Coach: Right.
416. Coach: You'll have the fuel behind it.
417. Coach: Exactly, yeah, a reason.
418. Coach: A reason.
419. Coach: You said earlier being purposeful is what helps you be productive.
420. [SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.
421. Coach: Did we miss anything here?
422. Coachee: I don't think so.
423. Coach: So if you're taking away something of value that you can hold on to, what is it in your words?
424. Coachee: It's...
425. Coachee: that I need more joy.
426. Coachee: And it felt like something completely different when we started this session.
427. Coach: I know.
428. Coach: And again, besides feeling the smile bursting, you know, from your cheeks, how will you know when you've touched on it or found it?
429. Marker: So one of the spaces that all of us seem to struggle with in both establishing the agreement and in the finalizing of the learning and growth is noticing the success measures, noticing the accountability process.
430. Marker: And Jennifer's doing all of this without using the word accountability at all.
431. Marker: She's simply asking very simple and direct questions about what is it that Brighton's going to notice that is going to let him know that he's doing what he wants to be doing rather than the messages that he started with, which was he was getting messages about what he didn't want to be doing.
432. Marker: So this is an easy and
433. Coachee: simple way to check for accountability and check that the client is really claiming the action or forward movement that they wanted I think it's going to be that reflection time each night to see if it did happen because I think it's so easy to reflect back on so it's easy to remember those good times just doing it on a daily basis
434. Coach: So knowing what you've told me, that little bit about you, procrastination and various things, what could potentially get in your way that's going to slow down this process that you want to be aware of?
435. Coachee: I think just the not doing it.
436. Coachee: Like, you know, it's a simple thing.
437. Coachee: It's also a simple thing to skip.
438. Coach: It's a simple thing to skip.
439. Coach: And so...
440. Coach: How meaningful is it to you?
441. Coachee: It's meaningful and I think that I need to tie it to something.
442. Coachee: Yeah.
443. Coachee: And I think maybe tying it to brushing my teeth at night might be the easiest thing to tie it to.
444. Coach: Like one of those little micro skills, you know, that they call it tasks where you're trying to retrain a micro habit.
445. Coachee: Micro habit.
446. Coachee: Yeah.
447. Coachee: Yeah.
448. Coach: Something that is like automatic.
449. Coachee: Right.
450. Coachee: Yeah.
451. Coachee: I've already got the habit of brushing my teeth every night.
452. Coachee: I might as well put more into that time.
453. Coachee: Yeah.
454. Coachee: That's easier, I think, than doing it in bed.
455. Coach: Yeah, I imagine.
456. Coachee: Yeah.
457. Coach: All righty then.
458. Coach: So, and do you need any support from me or anyone, your wife or anyone to help you stay accountable?
459. Coachee: Nope.
460. Coachee: I think I'll stay accountable to Colgate.
461. Coach: Remember, that's great.
462. Coach: And remember those multiple wins.
463. Coach: That really struck me when you said that there were so many layers of wins in that finding that joy.
464. [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
465. Coachee: Yes.
466. Coach: Anything else you need to say to feel complete today?
467. Coach: No.
468. Coachee: This was a wonderful, great first coaching session.
469. Coach: Thank you for allowing me to be your coach today.
470. Coach: Very good.
471. Marker: So one of the things that happened today is that I was having a one-sided conversation where normally mentor coaching is with two people, the person who is being the mentor coach and the person who is being mentored.
