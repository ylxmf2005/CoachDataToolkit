102. Marker: These patterns are behavioral models that the clients seem to repeat over and over again, unconsciously in different situations.
103. Marker: Uncovering these patterns could be a major turning point for the client.
104. Marker: They will become aware of these unconscious mindsets and behaviors, which is the first step towards change and transformation.
105. Marker: Another useful tool to help your clients see what they can't see is to give them the space to imagine their future.
106. Marker: This is an especially valuable technique for clients who are not sure what they want out of the coaching conversation because their goal is unclear.
107. Marker: Rich has a very fun way to do this and it goes something like this.
108. Marker: Three years have gone by.
109. Coach: I pick up the phone.
110. Coach: Hey Rich, it's Greg.
111. Coach: It's been three years.
112. Coach: Remember we sat on stage together at that event and I shared some stuff with you.
113. Coach: Well, these three years have been amazing.
114. Coach: My life has transformed, business, personal life, professionally, everything's transformed.
115. Coach: What would you be telling me, Greg?
116. Coach: Will you talk to me right now as if we're literally on the phone?
117. Coach: I'm going to pick up the phone in a second.
118. Coach: In present tense, you're telling me, well, here's how you're going to begin.
119. Coach: Are you okay with bad language?
120. Coachee: Yeah, oh yeah.
121. Coach: Okay, so you're going to start with this, holy shit, Rich.
122. Coach: So, Greg, hi.
123. Marker: I wasn't expecting to hear from you.
124. Marker: Holy shit, Rich.
125. Marker: Enabling your client to imagine their life as if they were in that present moment brings up their conscious or unconscious dreams.
126. Marker: It will be highly valuable for you as the coach to understand what direction they want to take so you can best help them get there.
127. Marker: What's next?
128. Marker: The third pillar is create the space for your clients to have insights.
129. Marker: Here's where many coaches make a huge mistake when trying to create results for their clients.
130. Marker: They give out all their advice, list down what they would do, and answer their clients' questions.
131. Marker: That's the exact opposite of what we should be doing as a coach.
132. Marker: Shifts don't happen because we give out all the answers.
133. Marker: It's like giving a student the response sheet before the exam.
134. Marker: They might pass the exam, but they surely won't learn anything.
135. Marker: The power of coaching is this, you're expected to give people the path to find the answers, not the answers.
136. Marker: Help your client by not telling them the insight, but through opening up the space for them to have the insights.
137. Marker: That's how real, profound, and lasting shifts happen.
138. Marker: Here's a great question Rich uses that you should write down.
139. Coach: Most people are seeking freedom from.
140. Coach: Freedom from my boss.
141. Coach: Freedom from my job.
142. Coach: Freedom from my wife, my husband, my boyfriend.
143. Coach: Freedom from my kids who've only had more time.
144. Coach: Freedom from debt.
145. Coach: This is a three-level distinction.
146. Coach: You can move beyond freedom from to freedom to.
147. Coach: That's a life changer.
148. Coach: Freedom to have a job that I love.
149. Coach: Freedom to make an impact.
150. Coach: Freedom to travel wherever I want to, whenever I want to.
151. Coach: And then there's a level beyond that, and that's freedom.
152. Coach: That's not freedom from or it's not even freedom to, it's the freedom that's inside of you that you have access to in any moment.
153. Coach: What do you hear when I share that distinction?
154. Marker: What do you hear when I share that distinction?
155. Marker: Allow your client to find the hidden gems from your conversations.
156. Marker: What emotions or thoughts are coming up?
157. Marker: What belief or mindset has surfaced that they didn't know they had?
158. Marker: What are they discovering about themselves that they weren't aware of?
159. Marker: The fourth pillar is to dive deeper into what your client needs.
160. Marker: Now, you might wonder, what do you mean by dive deeper?
161. Marker: We already uncovered what our clients need in the first part, right?
162. Marker: Well, yes, but as you move into the conversation and your client starts gaining insights, they will also notice new thoughts, behaviors, patterns arising and they hadn't seen those before.
163. Marker: This means they will also have more clarity on the direction they need to take and the action steps that should follow.
164. Marker: Here's an example on how Rich approaches this.
165. Coach: Where wouldn't I have gone?
166. Coach: What's the deeper cut we haven't yet gone to?
167. Coach: The thing you don't want to say.
168. Coach: Yeah, that one.
169. Coachee: That I think one of the things that really holds me back is...
170. Coachee: The way I have my business set up, I am not at all the face of my business.
171. Coachee: People know my name, but people don't really, like, if you look at any of my marketing, anything else, I'm really not the face of it.
172. Coachee: And I think that I'm incredibly afraid to put myself out there like that, even though I know it's something that I need to do.
173. Coach: That's a big one for you, right?
174. Coachee: It's a big one.
175. Coach: See what happens when you're willing to go where you, it looked like I was done.
176. Marker: So you're pretty bold coming up here then.
