454. Coach: It takes courage to sit on both sides, but especially when it's like, come and play in a space where others are watching.
455. Coach: So I also want to acknowledge that.
456. Coach: If we talk about something that you're like, meh, you know, just say, hey, I'll take that away.
457. Coach: So I want to make this safe for you.
458. Coach: So given that we have 11 and a half minutes.
459. Coach: Yeah.
460. Coach: I am curious, what can we focus on that will just make the most impact to your day or days coming up in the space that we have?
461. Coachee: Yeah, I think the thing I want to talk about today, I have a meeting coming up with my team next week that I like do not feel very good about.
462. Coachee: I'm not, I like have a clue about why, but I'm not sure why.
463. Coachee: And so I want to explore that a little bit.
464. Coach: Okay, so I hear you talking about the exploration of that something, that block, that something that may be blocking you from potentially having a really cool meeting with your team.
465. Coach: When you walk away, when you say that one thing, what is that one thing you want to walk away with?
466. Coach: What is that thing that will help you potentially unblock or clarity or whatever that is?
467. Coach: I'm curious.
468. Coachee: I think, I don't know.
469. Coachee: Yeah, I think there's like something, like I would love to have peace of mind walking into that meeting.
470. Coachee: Like that's how I wanna feel walking in and walking out.
471. Coachee: And I do not have that right now.
472. Coachee: And like, I think you said like blocking, it feels like there's something in the way and I don't know what that is.
473. Coachee: So I kind of wanna like, and it also feels like something that like once I'm able to piece it together, it's just gonna like lift.
474. Coachee: And I, but I can't, I can't put my finger on it.
475. Coachee: So I'd like to know what that is.
476. Coachee: And then like, yeah, I want to feel, yeah, I want to feel like joyful and optimistic walking in next Tuesday.
477. Coach: I'm curious, why can you, you bring up the, the joyful, the optimistic, what's important to you about the meeting next week?
478. Coach: You said it was with your team.
479. Coach: So what's in what's important to you?
480. Coach: Why do you want to have a good meeting?
481. Coachee: Right.
482. Coachee: Yeah.
483. Coachee: Well, I think on some level, because, you know, I don't want to not be joyful at work.
484. Coachee: But I think the other I think the other thing that's like going on, like in particular around this meeting is like it isn't it isn't a it's in a sequence of meetings where we're trying something different and we're going to assess how that went.
485. Coachee: And so that assessment is not about me.
486. Coachee: And I'm not the leader of the meeting.
487. Coachee: I'm just part of a team.
488. Coachee: But it is a shift we've made.
489. Coachee: And it's important to me that as a team, we are able to reflect deeply on what's been happening and what we want to be true going forward, if that makes sense.
490. Coach: It does.
491. Coach: So I'm curious, I'm going to take you to the end of the meeting.
492. Coach: I know we're not there yet, but I'm going to take you to the end of the meeting and you walk out and you will have peace of mind and you are joyous, as joyous as you want to be at work.
493. Coach: If you want to click your heels, go ahead.
494. Coach: But you're at the end of the meeting and you walk out being like, I feel peaceful.
495. Coach: That went really, really, really well.
496. Coach: What happened to the meeting for you to feel that?
497. Coachee: I think two things are coming to mind right now.
498. Coachee: One is that people shared what was there for them without filtering.
499. Coachee: And then I think the second is that I'm able to do the same.
500. Coachee: I show up in an authentic way and say my piece of that as well.
501. Coachee: Yeah.
502. Coachee: And I think if those things happen, the content of what's said is like not as important as like the spirit in which it's offered in this particular instance for me.
503. Coachee: And so, yeah, I think that would be enough to feel that way.
504. Coach: And I, I heard two things.
505. Coach: You talk about that unfiltered, authentic place, but also a generosity is what I heard in that, because it was this things that are, you know, in the spirit in which things are shared.
506. Coach: Um, so what do you need to let go of to be authentic in that meeting to be unfiltered?
507. Coach: If you want to, depending on how you look at those.
508. Coachee: Yeah.
509. Coachee: Yeah.
510. Coachee: Uh,
511. Coachee: I need to let go of?
512. Coachee: Yeah, a little bit of fear.
513. Coachee: And a little bit of assumption, I think, are the two things that are coming to mind.
514. Coachee: And I think those are like,
515. Coachee: a little bit of fear.
516. Coachee: Well, they're tied together, right?
517. Coachee: So the assumption is that my boss, who's in the meeting, wants things to be a particular way and is looking for an answer about the structure of the meeting that we're going to guess at, essentially, until we get it right.
518. Coachee: And I don't know that as a fact because I'm not inside their head.
519. Coachee: But it is an assumption that's like, as I say it out loud, I'm like, oh, I believe that right now.
520. Coachee: And yeah, and then a fear of like saying how I really feel about things.
521. Coachee: And I guess there's another assumption tied to that, which is that like a lot of other people on the team feel like I do in that way.
522. Coachee: So yeah, that's what I'm uncovering right now.
523. Coach: So I hear you talking about, again, those assumptions and that fear or that discomfort or something, right?
524. Coach: Because as you talk about it, does the person leading the meeting have an already predetermined endpoint, which then impacts that unfilter?
525. Coach: Because you did kind of put a filter on it.
526. Marker: Yeah.
527. Coach: And I'm curious, as you said, I have an assumption that others feel the same way that you do.
528. Coach: How does that impact your ability to just be unfiltered?
529. Coach: If you think, oh, whether they feel the same way or how other people feel, how does that impact your ability to be unfiltered?
530. Coachee: Yeah, I mean, I think of myself as like a person who reads people fairly well.
531. Coachee: And so I feel like there's this dynamic that has happened in our meetings in the past where it's like it's like an unspoken agreement of like, well, we're just going to like not push this any further because we're not going to get what we want.
532. Coachee: And so like I'm not going to like I can see that you're not saying what you how you really feel like in your facial expression, essentially.
533. Coachee: because we're all on zoom and um and and so i'm not going to do that either and and that's what i and then we leave and and then we don't we don't get anything that we want and then we like are doomed to another meeting just like that and so like i've just been through that cycle before and so i think that's that's what's giving me that assumption um and and to be honest some conversations about like yeah i didn't say anything there because i knew it wasn't going to change uh so it's
534. Coachee: It's an assumption that it will be true next week.
535. Coachee: It has been the case in the past.
536. Coachee: I guess it's probably a more accurate statement.
537. Coach: So Travis, I'm hearing this again, and I can sense where you were saying at first, you're like, there's this block where you're saying, I want to show up as unfiltered, authentic, say what I'm thinking.
538. Coach: And I want others to be doing the same at the same time.
539. Coach: you have seen, heard, experienced that it's, that's the opposite of what actually happens in reality.
540. Coach: People are edited.
541. Coach: They may not say what they're thinking.
542. Coach: And then you're doomed.
543. Coach: I think it is like you're doomed to have the same conversation over and over again.
544. Coach: So what is the conversation that you need to have that undooms you or ends the cycle?
545. Coach: Cause that in that authentic place you're talking about Travis.
546. Coachee: Yeah, I mean, okay.
547. Coachee: That's an interesting question.
548. Coachee: Part of the conversation, like the, I don't know.
549. Coachee: Well, maybe I don't know what you're asking because I think like my short answer is like, we need to stop having this meeting because it's lost its purpose.
550. Coachee: And I just like, I mean, that's my like blunt thought.
551. Coachee: It's like, all this could be said in an email is where I'm at with the meeting at this point.
552. Coachee: And we've tried a bunch of different things and it hasn't fixed that.
553. Coachee: And I think the cycle I'm seeing is like, if we don't say that and then do something about it, it's just like, cool.
554. Coachee: Like for an hour and a half every week, we're going to do this again.
555. Coachee: And I just like, that sounds horrible.
556. Coachee: And I think what's keeping me from like saying that, like as bluntly as I said it on this call is like,
557. Coachee: yeah, like a fear, like, I guess a couple of different thoughts, like a couple of different fears or somethings.
558. Coachee: I don't know.
559. Coachee: Like one is that's not what my boss wants because they've advocated for having this meeting.
560. Coachee: Right.
561. Coachee: And then they're like, cool, let's just change it and not get rid of it.
562. Coachee: Right.
563. Coachee: And then two is.
564. Coachee: yeah and then like a like i don't know like a sense of hopelessness that ties to the first assumption which is like that person has the final say like it's not my decision right and it's not our decision it's their decision so it's almost like yeah we're gonna like give feedback and stuff but like only up to a line you know and then there's some stuff that's like not on the table like canceling this thing
565. Coachee: Yeah.
566. Coachee: Did that answer your question?
567. Coachee: I'm a little, yeah.
568. Coachee: I'll admit I'm a little lost at this point.
569. Coach: So let's bring you back.
570. Coach: You said that you wanted to have
571. Coach: you wanted to explore what was holding you back from, or what was just niggling, I want to call it a niggle, what was niggling for you in terms of the meeting that's coming up.
572. Coach: And what I heard you say is there is this duality that you're living in.
573. Coach: That it's, I want to be real and I want to be blunt and in service to everyone by saying, by questioning, is this really a good use of our time, energy, spirit, whatever?
574. Coach: At the same time as understanding, you want to do it in a way that's real and respectful because, you know, does that still sound like, you know, that's the goal?
575. Coachee: Yeah, I would add like, I like real and respectful.
576. Coachee: And then I would add like effective, which like goes along with those things.
577. Coachee: But it's like, you know, I, you know, like respectful is a piece of effective, right?
578. Coachee: I think they like go pretty well together.
579. Coachee: But I think there's like a, you know, yeah, that's the third element.
580. Coach: So when you think about that meeting, when you're going in, and you're like, I'm going to prepare,
581. Coach: How are you going to with the skills that you have?
582. Coach: And I want to also acknowledge this willingness or this desire to have everyone walk away, not just part of the group walk away with something.
583. Coach: Everyone walk away with, hey, that was an effective use of our time.
584. Coach: Hey, I got to speak my mind.
585. Coach: How are you real respectful and effective?
586. Coach: What do you say?
587. Coach: What do you do?
588. Coachee: Yeah, this is helpful, because now, okay, like, the way I'm thinking about this is, one, I am going to say what I think.
589. Coachee: Like, there's no way to be, any of those three things, to be honest, yeah, yeah, there's no way to be any of those three things without, like, bringing my, like, full viewpoint.
590. Coachee: And I recognize the risk inherent.
591. Coachee: Like, I see that pretty clearly, and I'm okay with that.
592. Coach: Two minutes.
593. Coachee: Thank you.
594. Coachee: And I think that, like, where I'm left after that, so, like,
595. Coachee: in that realness or authenticity is like, what is the effective and respectful version of, um,
596. Coachee: Yeah, what is the effective and respectful version of what I want to say?
597. Coachee: And a very logistical question of, am I the first one to share out of a group of 10 people when the question comes?
598. Coachee: So I don't know the right answer to the second one, and I'm not sure how to say the first yet.
599. Coachee: But I know that's where I'm headed.
600. Coach: So given our time, what will help you get there?
601. Coach: Because again, this is a real realization that you're like, I need to do these things.
602. Coach: Here are the elements.
603. Coach: I don't know what the words are yet.
604. Coach: How will you develop that?
605. Coach: What space will you give yourself?
606. Coachee: Yeah.
607. Coachee: How will I develop that?
608. Coachee: Yeah, I think I'm gonna, I think the easiest thing to do would be, yeah, to just like to write out my statement.
609. Coachee: It's like how I process and then share that with someone and get some feedback.
610. Coachee: Probably one of my colleagues and just see how that, how that occurs to them.
611. Coach: So I want to go back on that feeling place.
612. Coach: When we started, you were like, there's something.
613. Coach: There's something.
614. Coach: I don't know why, but there's something about this meeting.
615. Coach: And, you know, now you've put those things in place of writing and kind of bouncing it off someone.
616. Coach: How are you feeling about the meeting next week?
617. Coachee: Yeah.
618. Coachee: Yeah.
619. Coachee: Better, but not for the reason I thought maybe.
620. Coachee: Like, yeah, no, I mean, I think like, I think saying out loud, like what I was like fearful about and my assumptions I had made, like, just like,
621. Coachee: yeah, like painted a clearer picture for myself of like what's on the table and what's not, or like what's on the line and what's not.
622. Coachee: And I think it was like beforehand, it was like kind of a vague unease.
623. Coachee: And now it's like, no, it's like this specific thing, this is the outcome that like may happen, you know, that really is out of my control.
624. Coachee: And even with that, here's like how I wanna show up and what I might wanna say.
625. Coachee: So that's kind of where I'm at right now, yeah.
626. Coach: And I want to commend you for that.
627. Coach: Like I do.
628. Coach: I'm grateful for that you brought this forward.
629. Coach: And I want to commend this.
630. Coach: I want to show up in a real way.
631. Coach: I want to show up to create a space for others to be in a real way at the same time as that real, respectful, curious place.
632. Coach: So I really want to commend you.
633. Coach: And I know that I think Lorraine is going to come on and give us some feedback.
634. Coach: Talk or give our observations.
635. Coach: Just so much gratitude to you, Travis.
636. Coach: And good luck next week.
637. Coachee: This was really helpful.
638. Coachee: Thank you.
