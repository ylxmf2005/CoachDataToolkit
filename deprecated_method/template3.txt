In the transcript of the coaching session, the Coach plays two roles: Coach and Marker.

Marker refers to when the Coach is commenting on or evaluating the coaching process with another Marker.
In this case, the Coach is discussing a previously completed coaching session with another Marker, where the Coach had a conversation with a Coachee.

For each entry in the transcript:
If the Coach is speaking with the Coachee, their label should remain Coach.
If the Coach is speaking with another Marker, or reviewing and commenting on the coaching session, replace the Coach label with Marker (Coach) to reflect their evaluative role.

Please go ahead and make these replacements in the transcript where necessary.
