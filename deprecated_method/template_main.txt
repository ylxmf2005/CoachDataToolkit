Above is a raw psychological coaching video transcription.
Your task is to identify the following:
1. Coach Identification: Determine which speaker(s) are the coach.
2. Coachee Identification: Identify which speaker(s) are the coachee(s).
3. Marker Identification: Identify if there is a speaker commenting or evaluating the coaching process, not part of direct interaction between coach and coachee. Marker may be a thrid-party or coach himeself.
4. Session Identification: Determine how many coaching sessions are present. For each session, provide the duration using line numbers. Note that a session starts when the coach and coachee begin interacting directly (instead coach speaking alone), and ends with the formal conclusion of their interaction.

Guidelines:
1. Use the JSON format to output finally, please reference the format of example. 
2. Before the finnal output, you are required to analyze the task first.
3. If a speaker is both a coach and a marker, the JSON value must follow the format [[l1, r1], [l2, r2], ...], representing the closed number ranges where the speaker is a marker. Avoid formats like ["Coach", [[l1, r1], [l2, r2], ...]]
4. If a speaker is only a marker, don't provide the list. The JSON value is just a str: "Marker"
5. Coachee cannot be a marker.
6. Ensure to label every speakers. A label can be assigned to multiple speakers. 
7. If a speaker cannot be labeled as either "Coach," "Coachee," or "Marker," please label the speaker as "Unknown".

Example input:
1. [SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our coaching session video series!
2. [SPEAKER_01]: Let's dive into our session now.
3. [SPEAKER_01]: What would you like to focus on today?
4. [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been feeling overwhelmed at work  I'm not sure how to balance my personal life with my job demands.
5. [SPEAKER_00]: Notice how the coachee is expressing a need for balance in their life.
6. [SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd be happier if I could just be more creative and play more often.
...
15. [SPEAKER_01]: Goodbye.
16. [SPEAKER_00]: Bye, thank you for you coaching.
17. [SPEAKER_00]: The coaching session ended. Now let's sum up...
