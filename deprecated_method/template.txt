Your task is to label a raw psychological coaching video transcription:

1. before_start: Before the coaching conversation starts(start refers to coach and coachee talking to each other instead of coach speaking alone).
2. start_coaching_with_coach_to_coachee / start_coaching_with_coachee_to_coach: The beginning of the coaching session where both the coach and coachee start their interaction. 
3. coach_to_coachee
4. coachee_to_coach
5. marker: Commentary or evaluation during the coaching process (from start_coaching to end_coaching), not part of the direct interaction between coach and coachee. Marker can be coach himself or a thrid-party.
6. end_coaching_with_coach_to_coachee / end_coaching_with_coachee_to_coach: The conclusion of the coaching session where the interaction between the coach and coachee formally ends.
7. after_end: After the coaching conversation ends.

There may be multiple coaching sessions.
