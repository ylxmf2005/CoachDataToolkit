1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:04,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to learn how a masterful coach works with clients?

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:11,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like a detailed view on their coaching techniques and how they use them in their coaching sessions?

3
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:13,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you asked and we listened.

4
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:22,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Ajit Nawalkha and today I'm breaking down a powerful real-life coaching session so you can be an even better coach.

5
00:00:29,957 --> 00:00:40,103
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn from the best and use master coach and Evercoach author Rich Litwin's live coaching session demonstration at Evercoach Summit 2016.

6
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:57,133
[SPEAKER_00]: To help you make the most out of this video, I'm going to take you through the step-by-step process of a powerful coaching conversation, show you some of the snippets of Rich demonstrating it, and then some action steps that you can easily implement.

7
00:00:57,993 --> 00:00:59,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get down to business.

8
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:08,315
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me or have been to any of our events, you know I like getting down.

9
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:12,196
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like getting down, give me a hell yeah in the comment section below.

10
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:15,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I digress, but we gotta have a little fun, y'all.

11
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:20,380
[SPEAKER_00]: To have a powerful session, you must have a powerful start.

12
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,143
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step is going to set the tone for the rest of the session, so make sure it's a great one.

13
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:31,605
[SPEAKER_00]: The first pillar is identify what they really need.

14
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:40,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, clients get a coach because they seek for help, but they're not clear on what they want and need from their coach.

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,765
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know when they look something like this.

16
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:58,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this clarity is crucial for you to guide your client in the right direction so you can create the results you're committed to create.

17
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:10,055
[SPEAKER_00]: So start the coaching conversation bringing this clarity by understanding where your client is coming from and diving deep into what they really need so you can best serve them.

18
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:15,150
[SPEAKER_00]: A great question to start with is, how can I serve you today?

19
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:16,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what I mean.

20
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:21,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently found myself laid off in May.

21
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:23,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a corporate trainer.

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a natural thing for me to talk.

23
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:32,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy usually when I'm talking and I find myself

24
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,268
[SPEAKER_02]: giving everything that I've got.

25
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,051
[SPEAKER_02]: But oftentimes, I'm in the layoff bunch.

26
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:41,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find that... What does that mean?

27
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:43,373
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the layoff bunch?

28
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:48,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, I'm in a sector of a business that gets laid off.

29
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:50,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm usually in the service sector or training sector.

30
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll find myself laid off after a couple of years or... So it's happened a number of times.

31
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:56,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

32
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:58,163
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my third layoff.

33
00:02:58,523 --> 00:02:58,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

34
00:02:59,024 --> 00:02:59,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So being... But...

35
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:01,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Love what I do.

36
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to train.

37
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:08,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I love to so let me pause you again for the sake of time How can I support you?

38
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:14,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that I need support in knowing that Everything happens for a reason.

39
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:25,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I find myself laid off but I think it's because I'm I should be moving into my purpose and it's terrifying to What's terrifying?

40
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:37,655
[SPEAKER_02]: it is terrifying to figure out what that is, lean in, live it every day, when I'm used to being given content or being told what to say.

41
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:51,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me to step out on my own, in my own message, to really kind of evolve without having, I guess... So let me ask you a question.

42
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,924
[SPEAKER_05]: What if, let's assume for a second that Blaine was correct,

43
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:57,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he might not be, but let's assume that he's correct.

44
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:59,885
[SPEAKER_05]: What he told us is that you don't need a message.

45
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:07,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Your clients are the ones who you need to listen to.

46
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:10,575
[SPEAKER_02]: To be quiet.

47
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,756
[SPEAKER_05]: How would life change if... To be quiet.

48
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:14,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be my challenge.

49
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:16,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to always talking.

50
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:25,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me to be quiet, to actively listen for that story, I think is also terrifying.

51
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would rather just sit here and talk all day about whatever.

52
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:29,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill the space.

53
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:30,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill the space.

54
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:34,607
[SPEAKER_02]: But to really be present, to really receive...

55
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:41,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And to know that I'm doing that efficiently, I think is also terrifying.

56
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:47,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that there's a difference between what they need and what they really need.

57
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:56,278
[SPEAKER_00]: In this short clip, we could see how Rich was trying to peel back the layers of the onion in order to get to the bottom things.

58
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,959
[SPEAKER_00]: What they really need.

59
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Know yourself and you will win all battles.

60
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:10,342
[SPEAKER_00]: As a coach, you must be able to wiggle your way through the layers and know when you've hit the jackpot of needs.

61
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:18,104
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they say they need help building their business, maybe what they really need is to work on their mindset or habits.

62
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:21,724
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of your go-to opening questions that stick?

63
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:23,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Share with me in the comment section below.

64
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:28,485
[SPEAKER_00]: The second pillar, help your clients see what they can't see.

65
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:32,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever played peek-a-boo with a baby?

66
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:43,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we're just hiding behind our hands, a baby doesn't realize this and get surprised every time you show up again.

67
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:49,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the thing that is right in front of you is the least obvious to see.

68
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,891
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where a coach comes in.

69
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:56,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's first watch Rich approach this pillar in his coaching demonstration.

70
00:05:57,595 --> 00:05:58,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had a building company until 2008.

71
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:03,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And tell me about that building company.

72
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,786
[SPEAKER_03]: That building company was from age 40 to 49, we did 18 million in sales.

73
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:18,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2008, when the economy fluctuated, you know, it was a good time to leave.

74
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:19,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

75
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:20,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that a hard time?

76
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:21,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a real hard time.

77
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:22,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I lost everything in 2008.

78
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:29,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was hard being fired, but losing everything, it takes it to another level, I get it.

79
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:30,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was devastating.

80
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:35,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember decorating the backyard for my daughter's graduation, and they were towing vehicles out of my driveway.

81
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a dad, so I feel that one.

82
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Just tell me back into your business, $18 million towards the end of it.

83
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:47,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Four years in, what was business like?

84
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,003
[SPEAKER_03]: In the building company?

85
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:50,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

86
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably 400,000, half a million maybe.

87
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:58,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

88
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:02,807
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you feel back then?

89
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:07,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it feel like we're a complete success or did it feel like we should be doing so much better?

90
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it never felt like a success.

91
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it didn't matter where I got.

92
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:12,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

93
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:13,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

94
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:28,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm hearing, if I'm right, is that one of the mindsets that helps you to succeed in life is if I don't feel like a success, then I have to take certain actions, do certain things, shop a certain way, and that leads to success.

95
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:31,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

96
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:33,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works, right?

97
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:35,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems to, yeah.

98
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,818
[SPEAKER_05]: So you not feeling like a success as a coach

99
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:47,603
[SPEAKER_05]: is what, at least until now, is the mindset that works for you.

100
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:49,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And you want me to take that away.

101
00:07:51,368 --> 00:08:16,071
[SPEAKER_00]: yes yeah i never looked at it like that's the mindset i've created to achieve success what rich does is he asks questions about the background and history to start identifying patterns that are being repeated in the client's behavior for example what were you doing before tell me about that time was it a hard time how did you feel back then

102
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:25,206
[SPEAKER_00]: These patterns are behavioral models that the clients seem to repeat over and over again, unconsciously in different situations.

103
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:30,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncovering these patterns could be a major turning point for the client.

104
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:37,630
[SPEAKER_00]: They will become aware of these unconscious mindsets and behaviors, which is the first step towards change and transformation.

105
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:45,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Another useful tool to help your clients see what they can't see is to give them the space to imagine their future.

106
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:54,939
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an especially valuable technique for clients who are not sure what they want out of the coaching conversation because their goal is unclear.

107
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich has a very fun way to do this and it goes something like this.

108
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:01,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years have gone by.

109
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:04,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I pick up the phone.

110
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:06,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Rich, it's Greg.

111
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:08,199
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been three years.

112
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:12,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember we sat on stage together at that event and I shared some stuff with you.

113
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, these three years have been amazing.

114
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:21,883
[SPEAKER_05]: My life has transformed, business, personal life, professionally, everything's transformed.

115
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:23,804
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you be telling me, Greg?

116
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you talk to me right now as if we're literally on the phone?

117
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pick up the phone in a second.

118
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:35,793
[SPEAKER_05]: In present tense, you're telling me, well, here's how you're going to begin.

119
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:36,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you okay with bad language?

120
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:38,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, oh yeah.

121
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:41,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you're going to start with this, holy shit, Rich.

122
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Greg, hi.

123
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't expecting to hear from you.

124
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:47,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, Rich.

125
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:56,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Enabling your client to imagine their life as if they were in that present moment brings up their conscious or unconscious dreams.

126
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:05,730
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be highly valuable for you as the coach to understand what direction they want to take so you can best help them get there.

127
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,551
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next?

128
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:11,035
[SPEAKER_00]: The third pillar is create the space for your clients to have insights.

129
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:17,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where many coaches make a huge mistake when trying to create results for their clients.

130
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:24,438
[SPEAKER_00]: They give out all their advice, list down what they would do, and answer their clients' questions.

131
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:29,302
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the exact opposite of what we should be doing as a coach.

132
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Shifts don't happen because we give out all the answers.

133
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,662
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like giving a student the response sheet before the exam.

134
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:43,647
[SPEAKER_00]: They might pass the exam, but they surely won't learn anything.

135
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:50,975
[SPEAKER_00]: The power of coaching is this, you're expected to give people the path to find the answers, not the answers.

136
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:59,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Help your client by not telling them the insight, but through opening up the space for them to have the insights.

137
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:03,807
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how real, profound, and lasting shifts happen.

138
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:07,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a great question Rich uses that you should write down.

139
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:10,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people are seeking freedom from.

140
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom from my boss.

141
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom from my job.

142
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom from my wife, my husband, my boyfriend.

143
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:20,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom from my kids who've only had more time.

144
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:23,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom from debt.

145
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:27,281
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a three-level distinction.

146
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:30,422
[SPEAKER_05]: You can move beyond freedom from to freedom to.

147
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:31,943
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a life changer.

148
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom to have a job that I love.

149
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:36,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom to make an impact.

150
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom to travel wherever I want to, whenever I want to.

151
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:45,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a level beyond that, and that's freedom.

152
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:56,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not freedom from or it's not even freedom to, it's the freedom that's inside of you that you have access to in any moment.

153
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:02,855
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you hear when I share that distinction?

154
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:07,890
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you hear when I share that distinction?

155
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow your client to find the hidden gems from your conversations.

156
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:15,235
[SPEAKER_00]: What emotions or thoughts are coming up?

157
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:19,319
[SPEAKER_00]: What belief or mindset has surfaced that they didn't know they had?

158
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:23,862
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they discovering about themselves that they weren't aware of?

159
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:28,226
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth pillar is to dive deeper into what your client needs.

160
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:31,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you might wonder, what do you mean by dive deeper?

161
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:35,553
[SPEAKER_00]: We already uncovered what our clients need in the first part, right?

162
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:52,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, but as you move into the conversation and your client starts gaining insights, they will also notice new thoughts, behaviors, patterns arising and they hadn't seen those before.

163
00:12:53,177 --> 00:13:00,403
[SPEAKER_00]: This means they will also have more clarity on the direction they need to take and the action steps that should follow.

164
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:03,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example on how Rich approaches this.

165
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Where wouldn't I have gone?

166
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:07,790
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the deeper cut we haven't yet gone to?

167
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,851
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing you don't want to say.

168
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:15,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that one.

169
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:27,123
[SPEAKER_01]: That I think one of the things that really holds me back is...

170
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,343
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I have my business set up, I am not at all the face of my business.

171
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:42,109
[SPEAKER_01]: People know my name, but people don't really, like, if you look at any of my marketing, anything else, I'm really not the face of it.

172
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:51,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that I'm incredibly afraid to put myself out there like that, even though I know it's something that I need to do.

173
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,561
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big one for you, right?

174
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:57,642
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big one.

175
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:02,807
[SPEAKER_05]: See what happens when you're willing to go where you, it looked like I was done.

176
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:08,635
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're pretty bold coming up here then.

177
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:14,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice how one simple question took the conversation even deeper than it was before?

178
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:23,865
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the power to push and challenge your clients more even when they think they might have already had all the insights they need.

179
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:25,306
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is there?

180
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,307
[SPEAKER_00]: What can be left to work on?

181
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,728
[SPEAKER_00]: If not in that session, in the next one.

182
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:37,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Start unlocking the mindsets they need to get rid of, the new behaviors they should embrace, and the action steps they should start taking.

183
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:41,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all came from one simple, powerful question.

184
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:46,856
[SPEAKER_00]: What would we have missed if we stopped the conversation at this moment?

185
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:53,341
[SPEAKER_00]: The fifth pillar is to know when to stop the conversation.

186
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:59,926
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important as a coach to know when to keep pushing your clients and to know when to stop.

187
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:12,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than ending the conversation when the time is up, notice when the client has had enough deep shifts and needs some downtime to process on what just happened and call it a day.

188
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:26,778
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep overloading them, it might backfire as they could find it too overwhelming to process or to move forward, or they might have too many insights and an unclear direction of their next steps.

189
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:35,164
[SPEAKER_00]: As Rich simply puts, another piece in the art of coaching is to know when to take somebody off the hot seat.

190
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:42,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the five pillars to deliver a powerful coaching conversation based on key elements from this live coaching demonstration.

191
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,509
[SPEAKER_00]: The first pillar was to identify what your client really needs.

192
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:50,350
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one was to help clients see what they can't see.

193
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:54,432
[SPEAKER_00]: The third was to create space for your clients to have insight.

194
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,814
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth was to dive deeper into what your client needs.

195
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:02,796
[SPEAKER_00]: The fifth pillar was to know and to stop the conversation.

196
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:08,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of these steps do you want to start trying immediately in your coaching sessions?

197
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Share it with us in the comment section below so we can all learn together.

198
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:17,580
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that you now understand how coaching session could look like.

199
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,463
[SPEAKER_00]: The demonstration snippets we just saw were from a powerful coaching conversation.

200
00:16:23,323 --> 00:16:27,406
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also deliver coaching sessions like that if you keep doing the work.

201
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:34,812
[SPEAKER_00]: My wish for you is that you continue to learn, practice, and get better and better in your coaching ability.

202
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:40,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like your interested curious self finished watching this educational video all the way till the end.

203
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:42,798

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,421
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know a few people who are curious like you.

205
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:50,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and share this video with them because sharing is caring.

206

[SPEAKER_00]: We release videos like this every week.

207
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:55,450
