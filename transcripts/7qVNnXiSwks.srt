1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, welcome.

2
00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:09,496
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get started in just a moment.

3
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:16,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And Stephanie, if you could click the record, we will get started.

4
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:18,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the top of the hour.

5
00:00:22,346 --> 00:00:26,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So once I know that that's happening, I will get chatting.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, welcome everybody.

8
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:35,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a number of people are coming in from various locations.

9
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:44,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am the, and Stephanie, you can, well, we can just leave the slide up, I guess.

10
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:47,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the CEO and founder of Coaching Out of the Box.

11
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:51,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love these live webinars.

12
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:55,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to just welcome everybody to the webinar for today.

13
00:00:56,585 --> 00:01:08,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And why we're doing this webinar is because in my experience as a longtime coach and coaching educator, one of the most powerful ways you learn to coach is to coach.

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly that, that's number one.

15
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:19,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, another way is for you to observe coaching and hear feedback on coaching as well.

16
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:23,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are in for a treat because we have that today.

17
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can move the slide along.

18
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:32,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to introduce some of the participants for this webinar for today.

19
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:36,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And first and foremost, you'll see Emily McDonald.

20
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:39,499
[SPEAKER_02]: She is our program advisor at Coaching Out of the Box.

21
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:40,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And she happens...

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,364
[SPEAKER_02]: to be in our current fast-tracked ICF credential program as well.

23
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:52,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So she has all the information about our program and our other programs as well.

24
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can reach out to her at any time with questions.

25
00:01:56,591 --> 00:02:00,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And Emily, do you want to just show your face and say hello?

26
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:02,056
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can?

27
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:04,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And say something?

28
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your mute off?

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how to?

30
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

31
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:10,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So

32
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:18,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, thank you for being here to help us out.

33
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:28,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And Emily will be watching the chat and picking up on anything people are saying and so on and trying to help you with your questions and so on.

34
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:32,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be introducing our coaches in a minute and our coaches as well.

35
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:37,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could move the slide across, Stephanie, that would be great.

36
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:41,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So the purpose is how it can happen in a short time.

37
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:45,204
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are really, they really kind of wonder about that.

38
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:49,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it happen and do some fantastic things in only five minutes.

39
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,414
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got more than that today, but, um,

40
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about using that approach.

41
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're also going to see some different styles of coaching.

42
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:11,575
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see how ICF coaches or how coaches use the ICF core competencies, which we are very committed to in training people in.

43
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:16,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to see coaching skills used in the moment.

44
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:29,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we will be doing is we'll be having 12 minutes of coaching, and then each real live coaching demonstration will be followed by 10 minutes of feedback.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to, I want to really, and then there'll be some Q&As happening as the whole entire webinar unfolds.

46
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:39,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're going to do.

47
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:44,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to also emphasize there has been nothing rehearsed here.

48
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are live.

49
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:47,831
[SPEAKER_02]: These are real.

50
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,771
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.

51
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Our coaches don't know what the topic is going to be.

52
00:03:52,053 --> 00:04:04,061
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know anything about what the person is going to be, because we want you to see real live coaching in the moment as as it happens out there in the real world, too.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could move the slide across again, and I already mentioned why we do this, because we want you to see it.

54
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:13,464
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to see it happening.

55
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:16,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can move that slide across.

56
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:18,306
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's what we're doing.

57
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:30,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do it, sorry, we do it because, as I mentioned before, it takes practice and it can be intimidating, kind of, when you first start out.

58
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully this will also support building your confidence as well.

59
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:48,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could move the slide across for us, because we want to really anchor you now in the definition of coaching.

60
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:50,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is partnering.

61
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's so critical with clients, customers, colleagues or employees.

62
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:55,324
[SPEAKER_02]: You can all read.

63
00:04:55,984 --> 00:05:10,548
[SPEAKER_02]: but still in a thought provoking and creative process that inspires people and inspires a person to maximize their personal and professional potential.

64
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:25,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why coaching has grown so much because it's about tapping into the wisdom, the ideas, the thoughts, the brilliance of the coachee, the person that we're working with and supporting them as they're finding their way.

65
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And Stephanie, if you could move that across.

66
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:34,806
[SPEAKER_02]: We also adhere to all the core competencies of coaching and they're all listed out here.

67
00:05:34,846 --> 00:05:37,388
[SPEAKER_02]: There's eight fundamental competencies.

68
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:44,408
[SPEAKER_02]: competencies that you will generally see demonstrated when you see coaching happening.

69
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:46,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is what these are.

70
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:58,775
[SPEAKER_02]: What will happen also is you'll be receiving, you'll get this all when we send out our follow-up email afterwards and we've also recorded it as well.

71
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:02,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be able to see that in addition to this.

72
00:06:03,318 --> 00:06:05,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not gonna go through all of them in detail.

73
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:08,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if you could move this across.

74
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:15,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I already mentioned, I mentioned the time and I would like to introduce our

75
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:21,878
[SPEAKER_02]: one of our fantastic coaches who is going to be doing one of the coaching demos.

76
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is Luray.

77
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Luray is a master certified coach, which takes a lot to accomplish that.

78
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:37,570
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of coaching hours, well, 2,500 now, and lots of experience and so on.

79
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is a long time, very, very successful coach and

80
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:45,616
[SPEAKER_02]: and coaching educator, because she is on our facilitator team.

81
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:50,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And she doesn't pull any punches in her coaching.

82
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:55,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see, and she taps into all that she brings to coaching.

83
00:06:55,525 --> 00:07:00,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering, and she also has her own coaching company, Soul Designs Coaching International.

84
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Lorraine, did you want to just say a couple of things?

85
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:06,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much, you can just say hi and...

86
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:10,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Alison, thank you for the lovely introduction.

87
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you hearing me?

88
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

89
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:15,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

90
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:16,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the introduction.

91
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said to you earlier, I'm so happy to be here.

92
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,796
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an exciting playground for me.

93
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to play in your sandbox anytime.

94
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:26,118
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for the invitation to be here.

95
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:33,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And just I think I'd like to just inspire people and see where people are coming from as I'm watching the chat.

96
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:38,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And I live in a very rural area of British Columbia called Scotch Creek.

97
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:52,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the benefits of coaching and the technology that we use to do our work, if you choose to use technology, you can live anywhere and create a life that you really love and a life that you desire.

98
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:56,544
[SPEAKER_03]: through this profession as well, which is one of the benefits.

99
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:57,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to speak to that as well.

100
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm so glad you mentioned that.

101
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,585
[SPEAKER_02]: That's huge, huge in coaching.

102
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:02,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks.

103
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:03,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for mentioning that, Lorraine.

104
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:08,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would also like to introduce Rosa as well.

105
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,548
[SPEAKER_02]: She is another fantastic coach.

106
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:18,771
[SPEAKER_02]: She holds her PCC, which is also a significant accomplishment in coaching and loads of experience.

107
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,671
[SPEAKER_02]: She's one of our,

108
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:22,592
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful coach facilitators as well.

109
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:27,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And she works with individuals and teams and has her own coaching business as well.

110
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:32,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and so, Rosa, would you like to say a couple of things?

111
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

112
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,732
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't apologize.

113
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:39,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Two things.

114
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:42,153
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I love coaching demos.

115
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:48,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the magic that happens because again, we don't know what's going to happen and magic can happen in 12 minutes, which is great.

116
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:55,516
[SPEAKER_00]: And seriously, anytime I can be in a room with Alison and Loray, I'm there, just sign me up.

117
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:56,797
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pleasure to be here.

118
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

119
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

120
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

121
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:01,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, all right.

122
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:12,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I would like to introduce our very first wonderful coach, coachee who has volunteered to be coach and it's Brenda Amon.

123
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:14,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I pronounced that right.

124
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:16,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda?

125
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:17,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Ammon.

126
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:18,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Ammon.

127
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:19,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Ammon.

128
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:20,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I apologize.

129
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:21,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda Ammon.

130
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And Brenda has agreed to be coached.

131
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:30,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And she would, I just really want to thank you, Brenda, for being willing to do that.

132
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:33,403
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very, very helpful.

133
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:37,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what makes these our coaching demo webinars.

134
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:42,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd also like to mention that Brenda will be coached by Lorraine.

135
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:46,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, Lorraine, you have 12 minutes.

136
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:49,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I will come in and how would you like to be told?

137
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:53,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a two minute warning is what I've usually done.

138
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:54,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that work for you?

139
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That works perfectly for me.

140
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:57,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

141
00:09:57,357 --> 00:09:57,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

142
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:58,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

143
00:09:58,258 --> 00:10:01,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And how would you like to get that warning?

144
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't notice it in the chat.

145
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you just come off mute, you don't need to come off video.

146
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:08,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Just come off mute and say two minutes.

147
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:09,643
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

148
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:11,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

149
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:12,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do that.

150
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:12,955
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

151
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:19,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further ado, I will let you get started and I will turn off my mic.

152
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:21,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

153
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:22,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Alison.

154
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Brenda.

155
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,281
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

156
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:31,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Lorraine.

157
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:32,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

158
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:34,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so good to be with you today.

159
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:37,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty excited.

160
00:10:37,264 --> 00:10:37,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

161
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:39,445
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

162
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Alison set up for us, we have 12 minutes together.

163
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Rosa mentioned, a lot of magic can happen.

164
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:47,171
[SPEAKER_03]: No pressure.

165
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:49,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happens between us happens.

166
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:51,932
[SPEAKER_03]: And I trust that that's what's right for you at this time.

167
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:58,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So given our time together, what is your topic for today or what you're bringing to coaching?

168
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:02,994
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been thinking about this for quite some time.

169
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:08,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to get better with my presence as a coach.

170
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,954
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like that's really important.

171
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:20,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice as I'm able to be more present, deep in my presence, I can better allow that space for clients.

172
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:30,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what's the top of mind for you is expanding your capacity for in-depth and coaching presence, that competency?

173
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:31,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

174
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:36,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's important to you about that is that when you do that for yourself, it allows you to do it for others.

175
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:37,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

176
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:38,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

177
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:44,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else that's important in expanding your coaching presence that's meaningful or significant for you at this time?

178
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:58,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I think about when you say that, Loray, is I've spent a lot of time inspiring people and wanting to be that source of inspiration.

179
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:06,674
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm learning as I work to deepen my presence as a coach is it's more as being a conduit for them to experience that in themselves.

180
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:06,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

181
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what's important for me.

182
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:13,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful, wonderful.

183
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:30,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So given that coaching presence and expanding that so that you can allow, create more space for others to allow them to experience that sense of presence and be that conduit, what is it that you'd like to gain in our time together that you don't have now?

184
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:35,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sometimes I realize in coaching, I might lean in too far.

185
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:36,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just did.

186
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:41,097
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I find myself leaning back.

187
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:47,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And so more in developing the presence, I want to just be right here with them.

188
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:50,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So really meet.

189
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:53,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you speaking in the physical realm?

190
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:58,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you speaking in the holistic, just for context?

191
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,752
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean to you to meet them where they are?

192
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:03,894
[SPEAKER_01]: To meet them where they are.

193
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:04,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I just...

194
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I think human beings are absolutely amazing.

195
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:21,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's sometimes I've been corrected to say, oh, you can't just go put a gold star on people's forehead, you know?

196
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:28,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do we let them feel that within themselves?

197
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do I be a presence for that?

198
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

199
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:33,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

200
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

201
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:35,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

202
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:53,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm really hearing show up between us and this at this moment is that is really your incredible, your beliefs about people and how much potential actually exists within them and that you're extremely passionate.

203
00:13:53,858 --> 00:14:01,643
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole thing about presence for you and expanding your coaching presence really creates an opportunity for people to

204
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:27,535
[SPEAKER_03]: to connect with that potential within themselves yes very much so so meeting people where they are then if that's what you're wanting to leave with how will you know that you've achieved that today with me um blind that achievement word is funny for me because I don't want it to be a reward um how will I know um

205
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you say that one more time?

206
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:34,971
[SPEAKER_01]: How will we know that we've achieved that today between the two of us or with a client?

207
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:53,001
[SPEAKER_03]: If what you're wanting to leave this conversation with is a sense of what it means to meet your client where they are in your coaching presence, how will you know that you've achieved that within our coaching today?

208
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:55,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say connection.

209
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:57,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Let down my guard.

210
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:26,703
[SPEAKER_01]: really set aside what the world thinks and what others think and just really be dialed in on their heart what's really meaningful to them ah maybe that's helpful like more set aside what's meaningful to me but focus on what's more meaningful to them okay you just had a oh moment what did you connect with there

211
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:32,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, and I feel it a little bit too, because I've always been such an inspiration.

212
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:35,224
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's the meaning that they want.

213
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:50,249
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm opening to my presence for the meaning that they want, not the meaning I want or see for them to be inspired, but what's meaningful for them, that will create that connection.

214
00:15:53,493 --> 00:16:17,048
[SPEAKER_03]: wow so what's really important about this moment what this this awareness that's emerged about opening up to what's meaningful to them wow I mean connection is so huge in coaching allowing people to be seen and heard just for who they are and just for like

215
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:25,728
[SPEAKER_01]: where they are right in front of me, not where I see them in the future or not where it's like right here, right now.

216
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,531
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a quote that comes to mind as I hear you speak, and you may have heard it.

217
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:34,812
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by Elizabeth Gilbert.

218
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:42,935
[SPEAKER_03]: To be seen, fully seen and loved anyway is a human offering that borders on miraculous.

219
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:46,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems to sum you up and where you are in this moment.

220
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:47,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

221
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:48,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

222
00:16:49,676 --> 00:17:16,694
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah okay that's powerful all right so where where does that where do you where do you what are you connecting with at this moment that you that that will support you in expanding your presence that's a great question it's almost like my heart and my gut but it's almost like inner knowing too that sometimes we cover this up and as

223
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,730
[SPEAKER_01]: is I can let that open up in me.

224
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it can be more available for other people.

225
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:24,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

226
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:30,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to be really clear, you say, when I cover this up, what is this that you're referring to when I cover this up?

227
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:36,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I think fully expressing myself as a leader.

228
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:37,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

229
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:38,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

230
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um,

231
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:52,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been hiding behind a lot of shoulds or how do we correctly do it for people or how do we exactly make it happen instead of like just fully expressing myself.

232
00:17:56,177 --> 00:18:02,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the time, so you've just recognized and you've just liberated, okay.

233
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what's this?

234
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,880
[SPEAKER_03]: What's now possible that wasn't before?

235
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling liberated.

236
00:18:12,714 --> 00:18:19,476
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much designing the presence, but it's being liberated in who I am and who I want to be for the person across from me.

237
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:21,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

238
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:28,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had this sense when you came in that around coaching presence, it was something that you felt you needed to do.

239
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:28,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

240
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,499
[SPEAKER_03]: What changed?

241
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that doing an achievement thing, right?

242
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to measure up.

243
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:42,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to be.

244
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:52,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as we can allow other people be, and I give myself that own permission, then you allow that permission to flourish in other people.

245
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

246
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:54,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

247
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:54,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

248
00:18:54,851 --> 00:19:00,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, so the being giving to yourself is,

249
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:03,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me go back to your word.

250
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:27,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Liberating yourself in this space and giving yourself permission to be fully expressed, fully seen, fully human in all your beauty and perfect imperfection actually is the path to expanding your coaching presence is where you're at right now because in that you're giving permission and you're creating space in the environment for others to do the same.

251
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:29,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

252
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:32,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and that makes me think about joy.

253
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:39,167
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much joy that we miss and fully expressing me is bringing way more joy.

254
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:40,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

255
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:43,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Presence, joy, peace.

256
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

257
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,331
[SPEAKER_03]: You just put a star on your own forehead.

258
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:53,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.

259
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:54,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

260
00:19:57,877 --> 00:19:59,078
[SPEAKER_01]: So no more hiding, Loray.

261
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I hear you.

262
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:01,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you.

263
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:10,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does that mean as far as what's different as a, you've made this contact, you've liberated yourself in this beautiful, in these beautiful moments.

264
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?

265
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:15,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does it translate into action?

266
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess is what I'm wondering about.

267
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:27,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we talked a few seconds ago or a few minutes ago about where is it, the heart, the gut, but fully expressing to me seems like

268
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:39,277
[SPEAKER_01]: expanse of the heart, you know, not be, you know, not be afraid of what might happen in there, but just still be in the presence.

269
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:41,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

270
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're doing this when you see me do this, what does that mean to you?

271
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:48,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Liberation of the heart.

272
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:49,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

273
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:50,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

274
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:55,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does that, what does that, how does that translate to

275
00:20:56,511 --> 00:21:04,438
[SPEAKER_03]: as you leave this conversation into your life, how do you cultivate and nurture this expansion of your heart?

276
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:10,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to be a dynamic leader and a coach, you've got to open your heart.

277
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:11,905
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to expand the heart.

278
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:13,666
[SPEAKER_03]: May I pause you for a moment?

279
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:19,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you go back and just language that as an I statement, please?

280
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:29,302
[SPEAKER_01]: As I step out as a dynamic leader, I have to be willing to open the expanse of my heart to be present for other people.

281
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:34,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how did that land when you said it, when you owned your language?

282
00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:38,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little nervous, but you know what?

283
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:40,985
[SPEAKER_01]: A little like, why not?

284
00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:43,466
[SPEAKER_01]: What else are we here for?

285
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:44,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

286
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, so that's the edge.

287
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:47,707
[SPEAKER_03]: You touched an edge.

288
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:48,828
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little like, oh, so...

289
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,911
[SPEAKER_03]: What in that space of what are we here for?

290
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,752
[SPEAKER_03]: You're ready for this.

291
00:21:54,852 --> 00:21:57,774
[SPEAKER_03]: It emerged so beautifully and organically in our conversation.

292
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:58,514
[SPEAKER_03]: You're ready.

293
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:06,860
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it that you need to continue to move this forward and nurture this as a leader, as a person, as a coach?

294
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:13,624
[SPEAKER_01]: To believe in my own heart.

295
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:15,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to believe in that first.

296
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And believing in that will...

297
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:42,973
[SPEAKER_03]: make me more present okay and willing to be with other people in that way yeah I feel that little edge yeah all right yeah so given that our time is up and in honoring the space for other people to be coached is there anything that you feel compelled or feel the desire to do

298
00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:50,888
[SPEAKER_03]: to support you in opening your heart, trusting your heart, believing in your own heart and being.

299
00:22:54,751 --> 00:23:02,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's totally okay to continue to inspire people because that's really a belief I have and energizes my own heart.

300
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:08,199
[SPEAKER_01]: But to know in coaching, I want to have it be about them finding that in themselves.

301
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it starts with you.

302
00:23:11,742 --> 00:23:13,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

303
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:13,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

304
00:23:14,318 --> 00:23:15,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

305
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:16,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

306
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Loray.

307
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:24,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for playing with me in that space and liberating yourself in this beautiful, important, important way.

308
00:23:25,225 --> 00:23:29,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of forgot about everybody in the room, but thank you for being here.

309
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:31,630
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

310
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that in itself was coaching presence.

311
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:34,952
[SPEAKER_03]: You felt it.

312
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:41,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone else goes away and you and I are in this special, unique space that we created together.

313
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:43,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done you.

314
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:45,747
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to reiterate that.

315
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:52,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Brenda, like, well done, first of all, of, you know, showing up whole self, come on in and doing this.

316
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:57,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said to everyone out there, it is magic to watch LeRae.

317
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:58,684
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.

318
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:08,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am looking forward to hearing, you know, as witnesses, as those people who are watching, what your comments are, what you took away, throw it into the chat.

319
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:09,396
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be watching that.

320
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:19,387
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brenda, I have a question for you before I turn to some feedback, some feedback, what I witnessed in the conversation.

321
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:19,487
[SPEAKER_00]: What...

322
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:46,313
[SPEAKER_00]: did loray do that allowed you to again move from what you were talking about to this awareness to almost a declaration at the end when you're like i will and you got the strength this different um strength in your voice what did she do no as you started to talk rosa i think and it's so funny i didn't know this at the time but i felt like loray was slowing me down

323
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:52,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowing me down to actually see that I do already believe in myself.

324
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:55,794
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay to believe in myself and to believe in myself.

325
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,396
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really where it starts.

326
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

327
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:02,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

328
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:02,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow me down.

329
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that Brenda, thank you.

330
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,479
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I want to repeat that was like 12 minutes.

331
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:16,745
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most for me, again, been doing this for a while I love watching Masterful Coaches.

332
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:24,351
[SPEAKER_00]: What I loved that you know if someone was watching and you're looking at the ICF competencies you're like check, check, check.

333
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:27,892
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that was woven into what Loray shows up as.

334
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:41,654
[SPEAKER_00]: She is someone who listens with a whole self, like seriously, whether it was mirroring, Brenda, your words back to you, you know, even at the end when it's like, oh, you just put a gold star on your forehead.

335
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:42,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were your words.

336
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,314
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, yeah, give them back to you.

337
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the physicality, right?

338
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,175
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this, you talked about presence.

339
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:52,056
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a space of I'm here, we're together, we're going to dance.

340
00:25:53,036 --> 00:26:00,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the mirroring back, whether it was, this is what I heard you say, um, or even this physicality of like, what does this mean?

341
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:03,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was zooming around because she saw what you were doing.

342
00:26:04,026 --> 00:26:10,911
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, um, even in that, you know, that beautiful space, the way that you created when you were, um, when it was like, uh, uh, uh.

343
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:13,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw an oh moment.

344
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,277
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't, hey, this is what I saw.

345
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:18,080
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I think it might be.

346
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,763
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, Brenda, you tell me what just happened.

347
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:21,484
[SPEAKER_00]: You own it.

348
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:23,045
[SPEAKER_00]: You explore it.

349
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:24,227
[SPEAKER_00]: You share it with us.

350
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:30,554
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there was this absolute, you know, again, excitement.

351
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:41,477
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone's looking, I know that when we talk to coaches and it's like, oh, that agreement place or, you know, when we talk about what do you want out of the 12 minutes and like, how do I help you move forward in that?

352
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:46,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will think that's kind of not robotic, but maybe formulaic.

353
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:47,658
[SPEAKER_00]: We all saw how Loray did it.

354
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:49,679
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, what are you bringing?

355
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,499
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to walk away with?

356
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving always back to the

357
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,961
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, talk to me about this presence.

358
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:07,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to me about how this is, you know, this is linked back to that goal that you said that you wanted, Brenda, and then moving to action.

359
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:10,785
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, yeah.

360
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:11,966
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to do that?

361
00:27:12,686 --> 00:27:33,031
[SPEAKER_00]: um how how how how how and powerful ways of saying put it into an i statement so that at the end we all i know i did i don't want to speak for everyone and i will um that there was this declaration i need to i will i believe in myself and even your voice got louder and and just stronger um so

362
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:40,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it is, Loray, you ask these questions.

363
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:42,256
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask beautiful questions.

364
00:27:43,137 --> 00:27:45,118
[SPEAKER_00]: What is important about this new awareness?

365
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:48,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't even just what was in that oh moment.

366
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,121
[SPEAKER_00]: We all felt it.

367
00:27:50,021 --> 00:27:52,263
[SPEAKER_00]: What was, you know, what was it?

368
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:54,164
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's important to you about it?

369
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:58,567
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gave that let's explore it and let's explore it a bit deeper and deeper.

370
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:01,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all saw you go really deep, really fast.

371
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:03,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was through those questions.

372
00:28:05,612 --> 00:28:10,676
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ability or the space, Loray, that you give for her to answer the question.

373
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:19,442
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of us will use those big questions and those exploratory questions that evoke awareness, and then it becomes the space too.

374
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:23,686
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go to the chat, Loray, I want to open it up and ask you, what...

375
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:31,429
[SPEAKER_00]: What enables you, I'll kind of speak it, what enables you to stay in that dance?

376
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:32,870
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't know what Brenda was bringing.

377
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,390
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't.

378
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And she brought something sort of big.

379
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,172
[SPEAKER_00]: What enables you to do that when you're in the conversation?

380
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:45,994
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you holding, Loray?

381
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:50,675
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 555 coaching out of the box coaching model.

382
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,636
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's,

383
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So the structure, it's practice, of course, it's practice.

384
00:28:59,265 --> 00:29:04,949
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's all who I'm being plus what I do equals the magic of coaching.

385
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll even add a third one.

386
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:12,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It's who I'm being, how I'm seeing myself and others and what I do.

387
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:21,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So being present, being open, being unattached, giving up the need to know

388
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:24,324
[SPEAKER_03]: the answers for Brenda and really try.

389
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:26,004
[SPEAKER_03]: So that goes to how I'm seeing her.

390
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:31,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing her as whole resourceful and having capacity in each moment and in her life.

391
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:37,629
[SPEAKER_03]: But in order to see her in that way, I have to see myself just like Brenda said, it starts with me.

392
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:39,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to see myself in those ways too.

393
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,652
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can be responsive to her and let go of the need to know.

394
00:29:43,672 --> 00:29:46,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the skills that I've learned, the training I've taken,

395
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:56,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And the structure of the coaching conversation, which supports it all, it contains it all, the 555 model, it all holds it.

396
00:29:56,602 --> 00:30:01,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's trusting myself, trusting the process, and trusting others, and trusting my clients.

397
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:03,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And practice.

398
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:03,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

399
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:14,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I hear in that practice, there's a courage and that happens in the practice, right?

400
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:21,226
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this like, I'm going to try this and oh, wait a second, I'm going to get my groove and then I'm going to trust myself and then I'm going to be in that.

401
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,747
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a great question and there's some wonderful comments.

402
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:30,991
[SPEAKER_00]: um, about what Loray did and that awareness and, and Brenda, I will again, speak to that courage of just showing up and being in it.

403
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:39,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Alan asks, how do we as coaches prolong the total presence we experienced at the end of the session for ourselves and clients?

404
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:46,698
[SPEAKER_00]: So many distraction triggers in the day to day life, pulling at us, um, uh, pulling us away from that divine presence.

405
00:30:46,738 --> 00:30:51,661
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is that, you know, this is 12 minutes and you're talking about, um, that we talked

406
00:30:51,781 --> 00:31:21,276
[SPEAKER_00]: about that presence place so I'll actually before I you know I'll pose that question to you Loray is when you're in with someone and you're seeing someone in that coaching place and you're listening and you're being and you're creating how do you continue showing up as you in that distraction field you know when your mind's like what is the next question or or or that that's I was referring to is the art of giving up the need to know also embodies a practice of

407
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:30,763
[SPEAKER_03]: of allowing myself to fall in love with my clients and who they are and what they're saying and be my curiosity, pure curiosity.

408
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:34,786
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm like, can you think about a kid when they're like curious about an ant on the sidewalk?

409
00:31:35,146 --> 00:31:36,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing else exists.

410
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:42,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched my child walk right into like a car head on while he's watching a bug, like following a bug, right?

411
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:46,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it not aware of what's going on around just right there in the moment.

412
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:50,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think there is a practice that we cultivate have I over the years,

413
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,180
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivated a practice of meditation.

414
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,662
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where embodying the coaching mindset, which is number two competency.

415
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:02,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really important that reflective practice, that way of bringing ourselves in.

416
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:11,589
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just have a standard that I hold for myself that I clear myself before, even if it's only five minutes I have between sessions.

417
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:17,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I put myself at the door and it's a practice.

418
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:21,544
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a perfect because I don't get it right all the time.

419
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:26,585
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a practice.

420
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:30,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love what you bring up and we talk about it in personal groundwork.

421
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:34,707
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go through fast track, anyone who's gone through fast track, we talk about it in personal groundwork.

422
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:39,928
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of, you know, that portion of the five, five, five, it's those five guiding principles is how we show up as coaches.

423
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:43,809
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see Alison, I'm like, are we at a 10 minutes?

424
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:44,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we're not.

425
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:49,383
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that we can talk about it all the time, but it is how you show up.

426
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:51,884
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that how you show up is how you serve.

427
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:53,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

428
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:57,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just love how much acknowledgement there is for you in the chat, Brenda.

429
00:32:57,587 --> 00:33:00,028
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat and the acknowledgement.

430
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you haven't read them, please do.

431
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like no more hiding and declaration of self.

432
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:06,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love your language, Rosa.

[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you so much, Brenda, for being willing to do this.

[SPEAKER_02]: And just so many so many things and lovely to see some familiar names to

00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:51,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And there he is.

443
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:52,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

444
00:33:52,973 --> 00:34:00,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rosa will be coaching Travis and Rosa, how would you like me to give you your two minute warning?

445
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:03,041
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love if you could just pop on audio and say two minutes.

446
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:03,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love that.

447
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:04,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.

448
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:04,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So much.

449
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:05,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

450
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:11,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And okay, so I'll pop off and let the two of you get started.

451
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:12,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

452
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks again, Travis.

453
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:16,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to acknowledge that again, Travis.

454
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:24,928
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes courage to sit on both sides, but especially when it's like, come and play in a space where others are watching.

455
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:26,649
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also want to acknowledge that.

456
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:32,672
[SPEAKER_00]: If we talk about something that you're like, meh, you know, just say, hey, I'll take that away.

457
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:35,094
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make this safe for you.

458
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So given that we have 11 and a half minutes.

459
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:38,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

460
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:50,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I am curious, what can we focus on that will just make the most impact to your day or days coming up in the space that we have?

461
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:58,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the thing I want to talk about today, I have a meeting coming up with my team next week that I like do not feel very good about.

462
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:03,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, I like have a clue about why, but I'm not sure why.

463
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to explore that a little bit.

464
00:35:06,653 --> 00:35:20,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I hear you talking about the exploration of that something, that block, that something that may be blocking you from potentially having a really cool meeting with your team.

465
00:35:22,776 --> 00:35:27,277
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk away, when you say that one thing, what is that one thing you want to walk away with?

466
00:35:27,397 --> 00:35:32,538
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that thing that will help you potentially unblock or clarity or whatever that is?

467
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:33,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.

468
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I don't know.

469
00:35:39,401 --> 00:35:44,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think there's like something, like I would love to have peace of mind walking into that meeting.

470
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:47,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's how I wanna feel walking in and walking out.

471
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:49,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do not have that right now.

472
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:53,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I think you said like blocking, it feels like there's something in the way and I don't know what that is.

473
00:35:54,613 --> 00:36:00,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of wanna like, and it also feels like something that like once I'm able to piece it together, it's just gonna like lift.

474
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:04,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, but I can't, I can't put my finger on it.

475
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:05,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to know what that is.

476
00:36:06,078 --> 00:36:11,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like, yeah, I want to feel, yeah, I want to feel like joyful and optimistic walking in next Tuesday.

477
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, why can you, you bring up the, the joyful, the optimistic, what's important to you about the meeting next week?

478
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:22,262
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it was with your team.

479
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:24,083
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's in what's important to you?

480
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you want to have a good meeting?

481
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:26,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

482
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:26,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

483
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:31,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think on some level, because, you know, I don't want to not be joyful at work.

484
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:45,330
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the other I think the other thing that's like going on, like in particular around this meeting is like it isn't it isn't a it's in a sequence of meetings where we're trying something different and we're going to assess how that went.

485
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that assessment is not about me.

486
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:50,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not the leader of the meeting.

487
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:52,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just part of a team.

488
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:56,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is a shift we've made.

489
00:36:56,615 --> 00:37:07,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's important to me that as a team, we are able to reflect deeply on what's been happening and what we want to be true going forward, if that makes sense.

490
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,600
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.

491
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:12,522
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious, I'm going to take you to the end of the meeting.

492
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:24,711
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're not there yet, but I'm going to take you to the end of the meeting and you walk out and you will have peace of mind and you are joyous, as joyous as you want to be at work.

493
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:26,212
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to click your heels, go ahead.

494
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:30,776
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're at the end of the meeting and you walk out being like, I feel peaceful.

495
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:33,698
[SPEAKER_00]: That went really, really, really well.

496
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,700
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to the meeting for you to feel that?

497
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:54,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I think two things are coming to mind right now.

498
00:37:54,671 --> 00:38:00,334
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that people shared what was there for them without filtering.

499
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:06,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think the second is that I'm able to do the same.

500
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:12,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I show up in an authentic way and say my piece of that as well.

501
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:14,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

502
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:24,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if those things happen, the content of what's said is like not as important as like the spirit in which it's offered in this particular instance for me.

503
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:29,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I think that would be enough to feel that way.

504
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:31,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I heard two things.

505
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:41,274
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about that unfiltered, authentic place, but also a generosity is what I heard in that, because it was this things that are, you know, in the spirit in which things are shared.

506
00:38:42,074 --> 00:38:49,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so what do you need to let go of to be authentic in that meeting to be unfiltered?

507
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,902
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, depending on how you look at those.

508
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:52,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

509
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:54,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

510
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:54,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh,

511
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:57,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to let go of?

512
00:38:58,008 --> 00:38:58,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit of fear.

513
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:03,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And a little bit of assumption, I think, are the two things that are coming to mind.

514
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think those are like,

515
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:07,538
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit of fear.

516
00:39:07,658 --> 00:39:09,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're tied together, right?

517
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:26,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So the assumption is that my boss, who's in the meeting, wants things to be a particular way and is looking for an answer about the structure of the meeting that we're going to guess at, essentially, until we get it right.

518
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:31,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know that as a fact because I'm not inside their head.

519
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:36,326
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is an assumption that's like, as I say it out loud, I'm like, oh, I believe that right now.

520
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:43,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, and then a fear of like saying how I really feel about things.

521
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:50,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess there's another assumption tied to that, which is that like a lot of other people on the team feel like I do in that way.

522
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:53,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's what I'm uncovering right now.

523
00:39:57,054 --> 00:40:02,559
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear you talking about, again, those assumptions and that fear or that discomfort or something, right?

524
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:16,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you talk about it, does the person leading the meeting have an already predetermined endpoint, which then impacts that unfilter?

525
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you did kind of put a filter on it.

526
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:18,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

527
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:25,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious, as you said, I have an assumption that others feel the same way that you do.

528
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,981
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that impact your ability to just be unfiltered?

529
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:35,768
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think, oh, whether they feel the same way or how other people feel, how does that impact your ability to be unfiltered?

530
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:41,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think of myself as like a person who reads people fairly well.

531
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:54,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I feel like there's this dynamic that has happened in our meetings in the past where it's like it's like an unspoken agreement of like, well, we're just going to like not push this any further because we're not going to get what we want.

532
00:40:54,861 --> 00:41:01,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like I'm not going to like I can see that you're not saying what you how you really feel like in your facial expression, essentially.

533
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:28,504
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're all on zoom and um and and so i'm not going to do that either and and that's what i and then we leave and and then we don't we don't get anything that we want and then we like are doomed to another meeting just like that and so like i've just been through that cycle before and so i think that's that's what's giving me that assumption um and and to be honest some conversations about like yeah i didn't say anything there because i knew it wasn't going to change uh so it's

534
00:41:29,204 --> 00:41:32,205
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an assumption that it will be true next week.

535
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:34,006
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been the case in the past.

536
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:35,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's probably a more accurate statement.

537
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:50,654
[SPEAKER_00]: So Travis, I'm hearing this again, and I can sense where you were saying at first, you're like, there's this block where you're saying, I want to show up as unfiltered, authentic, say what I'm thinking.

538
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:54,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want others to be doing the same at the same time.

539
00:41:56,437 --> 00:42:01,879
[SPEAKER_00]: you have seen, heard, experienced that it's, that's the opposite of what actually happens in reality.

540
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,020
[SPEAKER_00]: People are edited.

541
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:06,361
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not say what they're thinking.

542
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:07,682
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're doomed.

543
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:11,063
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is like you're doomed to have the same conversation over and over again.

544
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:19,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the conversation that you need to have that undooms you or ends the cycle?

545
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:21,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that in that authentic place you're talking about Travis.

546
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:24,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, okay.

547
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,960
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting question.

548
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:30,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the conversation, like the, I don't know.

549
00:42:30,343 --> 00:42:36,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe I don't know what you're asking because I think like my short answer is like, we need to stop having this meeting because it's lost its purpose.

550
00:42:37,448 --> 00:42:41,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just like, I mean, that's my like blunt thought.

551
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,933
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, all this could be said in an email is where I'm at with the meeting at this point.

552
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've tried a bunch of different things and it hasn't fixed that.

553
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:53,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the cycle I'm seeing is like, if we don't say that and then do something about it, it's just like, cool.

554
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for an hour and a half every week, we're going to do this again.

555
00:42:56,422 --> 00:42:59,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just like, that sounds horrible.

556
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:08,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what's keeping me from like saying that, like as bluntly as I said it on this call is like,

557
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:14,976
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, like a fear, like, I guess a couple of different thoughts, like a couple of different fears or somethings.

558
00:43:15,216 --> 00:43:15,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

559
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:21,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one is that's not what my boss wants because they've advocated for having this meeting.

560
00:43:21,878 --> 00:43:22,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

561
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:24,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're like, cool, let's just change it and not get rid of it.

562
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:24,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

563
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:25,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And then two is.

564
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:46,455
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah and then like a like i don't know like a sense of hopelessness that ties to the first assumption which is like that person has the final say like it's not my decision right and it's not our decision it's their decision so it's almost like yeah we're gonna like give feedback and stuff but like only up to a line you know and then there's some stuff that's like not on the table like canceling this thing

565
00:43:46,997 --> 00:43:48,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

566
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that answer your question?

567
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:51,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little, yeah.

568
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll admit I'm a little lost at this point.

569
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's bring you back.

570
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:57,888
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you wanted to have

571
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:10,946
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanted to explore what was holding you back from, or what was just niggling, I want to call it a niggle, what was niggling for you in terms of the meeting that's coming up.

572
00:44:11,406 --> 00:44:14,688
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I heard you say is there is this duality that you're living in.

573
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:25,234
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's, I want to be real and I want to be blunt and in service to everyone by saying, by questioning, is this really a good use of our time, energy, spirit, whatever?

574
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:36,379
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time as understanding, you want to do it in a way that's real and respectful because, you know, does that still sound like, you know, that's the goal?

575
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:40,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would add like, I like real and respectful.

576
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:44,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would add like effective, which like goes along with those things.

577
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:50,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like, you know, I, you know, like respectful is a piece of effective, right?

578
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:52,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they like go pretty well together.

579
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:56,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there's like a, you know, yeah, that's the third element.

580
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:02,564
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about that meeting, when you're going in, and you're like, I'm going to prepare,

581
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:07,375
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to with the skills that you have?

582
00:45:09,157 --> 00:45:18,105
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to also acknowledge this willingness or this desire to have everyone walk away, not just part of the group walk away with something.

583
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone walk away with, hey, that was an effective use of our time.

584
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:23,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I got to speak my mind.

585
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,354
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you real respectful and effective?

586
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:28,074
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say?

587
00:45:28,134 --> 00:45:28,615
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?

588
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:36,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is helpful, because now, okay, like, the way I'm thinking about this is, one, I am going to say what I think.

589
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:46,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there's no way to be, any of those three things, to be honest, yeah, yeah, there's no way to be any of those three things without, like, bringing my, like, full viewpoint.

590
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,661
[SPEAKER_04]: And I recognize the risk inherent.

591
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:51,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I see that pretty clearly, and I'm okay with that.

592
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:53,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Two minutes.

593
00:45:53,963 --> 00:45:54,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

594
00:45:55,023 --> 00:45:58,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, like, where I'm left after that, so, like,

595
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:07,151
[SPEAKER_04]: in that realness or authenticity is like, what is the effective and respectful version of, um,

596
00:46:11,516 --> 00:46:14,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what is the effective and respectful version of what I want to say?

597
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:23,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And a very logistical question of, am I the first one to share out of a group of 10 people when the question comes?

598
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:28,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know the right answer to the second one, and I'm not sure how to say the first yet.

599
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,471
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that's where I'm headed.

600
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:36,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So given our time, what will help you get there?

601
00:46:36,236 --> 00:46:39,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, this is a real realization that you're like, I need to do these things.

602
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the elements.

603
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:41,902
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the words are yet.

604
00:46:43,163 --> 00:46:44,344
[SPEAKER_00]: How will you develop that?

605
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,545
[SPEAKER_00]: What space will you give yourself?

606
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

607
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,091
[SPEAKER_01]: How will I develop that?

608
00:46:52,270 --> 00:47:01,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I'm gonna, I think the easiest thing to do would be, yeah, to just like to write out my statement.

609
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:08,614
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like how I process and then share that with someone and get some feedback.

610
00:47:08,714 --> 00:47:14,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably one of my colleagues and just see how that, how that occurs to them.

611
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:20,882
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to go back on that feeling place.

612
00:47:20,942 --> 00:47:23,504
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started, you were like, there's something.

613
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:24,364
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something.

614
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but there's something about this meeting.

615
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:34,312
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, now you've put those things in place of writing and kind of bouncing it off someone.

616
00:47:35,654 --> 00:47:37,535
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you feeling about the meeting next week?

617
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

618
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:39,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

619
00:47:41,545 --> 00:47:43,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Better, but not for the reason I thought maybe.

620
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:54,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, no, I mean, I think like, I think saying out loud, like what I was like fearful about and my assumptions I had made, like, just like,

621
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:00,975
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, like painted a clearer picture for myself of like what's on the table and what's not, or like what's on the line and what's not.

622
00:48:01,436 --> 00:48:04,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was like beforehand, it was like kind of a vague unease.

623
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:10,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like, no, it's like this specific thing, this is the outcome that like may happen, you know, that really is out of my control.

624
00:48:11,064 --> 00:48:14,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And even with that, here's like how I wanna show up and what I might wanna say.

625
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:16,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of where I'm at right now, yeah.

626
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:18,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to commend you for that.

627
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:18,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do.

628
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:21,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for that you brought this forward.

629
00:48:21,913 --> 00:48:23,253
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to commend this.

630
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:25,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show up in a real way.

631
00:48:25,354 --> 00:48:32,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show up to create a space for others to be in a real way at the same time as that real, respectful, curious place.

632
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,198
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really want to commend you.

633
00:48:35,238 --> 00:48:38,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I think Lorraine is going to come on and give us some feedback.

634
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk or give our observations.

635
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:43,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so much gratitude to you, Travis.

636
00:48:44,082 --> 00:48:45,183
[SPEAKER_00]: And good luck next week.

637
00:48:45,203 --> 00:48:45,663
[SPEAKER_04]: This was really helpful.

638
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:45,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

639
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:54,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to put on 10 minutes because being on time is not my jam as far as trying to keep it tight.

640
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:58,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you two, thank you so much for that.

641
00:48:58,259 --> 00:49:03,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis, thank you for showing up, being you, and Rosa for being just fabulous.

642
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:10,301
[SPEAKER_03]: You were responsive and holding a space for Travis to explore and to think and for us all to witness you both.

643
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:11,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

644
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:15,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis, in that experience, coaching is really important.

645
00:49:16,132 --> 00:49:18,574
[SPEAKER_03]: for you, about you, as you may know.

646
00:49:18,594 --> 00:49:26,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what is it that emerged for you that was most important in that 12 minute coaching with Rosa?

647
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:36,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think the most important thing for me was like clarity of thought and like advancing that like thought process that I haven't been able to do inside my own head yet.

648
00:49:37,134 --> 00:49:50,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like having Rosa kind of like guide me along that and then, you know, like mirror back to me what was like what I was saying out loud was really helpful just to, yeah, to make it from this like cloudy thing into something like pretty clear.

649
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:52,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you've got some clarity.

650
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:53,889
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's most important to you.

651
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that you're clear, what is possible that wasn't 12 minutes ago?

652
00:49:58,074 --> 00:49:59,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

653
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:01,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

654
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:04,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

655
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:13,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think like I was walking into that meeting or like, I was like a little bit resigned about like walking into the meeting on Tuesday and being like, who knows, you know, like, I just can't get my head around this.

656
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:21,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm dreading this moment and you know, and I think like, and I have enough experience to know that like, if that's how you walk in with dread, you're also leaving the same thing.

657
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:24,215
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a little bit of me was just like resigned to that.

658
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:26,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, which is why this is great.

659
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:28,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

660
00:50:29,197 --> 00:50:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So something that's possible that wasn't before is hope.

661
00:50:33,211 --> 00:50:33,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

662
00:50:33,851 --> 00:50:34,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

663
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:34,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope.

664
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:51,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I think like some, um, I think there's like something possible about like having some like peace about the outcome, regardless of what it is of like, if I show up in this way and say what I would need to say, it actually doesn't matter what happens.

665
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:52,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like how I can still leave.

666
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like dropping Mike's Travis do it.

667
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:57,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

668
00:50:57,942 --> 00:50:58,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

669
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

670
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:07,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

671
00:51:08,454 --> 00:51:26,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I'm just really struck by the impact of what you just said, Travis, and what you just said, it's possible that wasn't before because resignation to that type of there's capacity, there's opportunities, there's potential talk about tapping into potential.

672
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:30,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And you did that work.

673
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:35,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosa modeled for us responsiveness and attachment.

674
00:51:36,224 --> 00:51:37,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me give you an example.

675
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:38,545
[SPEAKER_03]: She asked you a question.

676
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:41,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the conversation that you need to have?

677
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:50,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, well, I don't know about that, but this is what, and you started talking about and connecting with your fear.

678
00:51:51,656 --> 00:51:57,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was so beautiful and why it was really a significant, important piece for the people that are watching today.

679
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:05,053
[SPEAKER_03]: is because it demonstrates the significance and the importance of being unattached and practicing the art of giving up the need to know.

680
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:19,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if Rosa had got all concerned about the fact that, oh, maybe I asked the wrong question or, oh, I didn't get it right, that would have affected her responsiveness to you, Travis, and you might not have gotten the space to be able to go and check out those fears.

681
00:52:19,782 --> 00:52:21,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you said, oh, did I answer your question?

682
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:25,266
[SPEAKER_03]: She might have needed to pull you back and say,

683
00:52:25,825 --> 00:52:26,325
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you didn't.

684
00:52:26,445 --> 00:52:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: This was, you know, come back.

685
00:52:27,905 --> 00:52:29,626
[SPEAKER_03]: But she just stayed with you.

686
00:52:30,746 --> 00:52:33,687
[SPEAKER_03]: She followed you and the response to you.

687
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:40,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And and through that, you've shifted from a resignation to potential.

688
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is as per the definition that Allison introduced to us, the ICF definition of coaching.

689
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:49,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.

690
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was the mic drop.

691
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,110
Yeah.

692
00:52:53,223 --> 00:52:55,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So just fantastic, both of you.

693
00:52:56,324 --> 00:53:07,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I might add to the other thing that I just want, Alison emphasized the absolute importance of partnering, and that's a bit jargony in the coaching world.

694
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:20,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you did for us, both of you, was that you demonstrated partnering for us, which is a combination of coaching presence, the integration of the coaching skills,

695
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:34,351
[SPEAKER_03]: listening, encouraging, questioning, well, you didn't make any requests, but action planning, along with who you're being with Travis in response to Travis.

696
00:53:35,032 --> 00:53:44,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was that openness where so much was explored and just your own curiosity, Rosa, that really drove those questions.

697
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:48,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't sense of, well, this is the right question to ask, tick the box.

698
00:53:48,297 --> 00:53:48,537
[SPEAKER_03]: It was

699
00:53:49,028 --> 00:53:52,890
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's inspired in me as a result of what I'm hearing.

700
00:53:54,010 --> 00:54:00,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And you actually demonstrated that for us in your language because what I'm hearing is, so you're actively listening to him.

701
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:02,374
[SPEAKER_03]: You're letting, so here's the thing.

702
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,735
[SPEAKER_03]: People do not hear what they say.

703
00:54:04,855 --> 00:54:07,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no clue what I just said 30 seconds ago.

704
00:54:07,596 --> 00:54:07,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

705
00:54:08,057 --> 00:54:10,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why it's so great we're recording this.

706
00:54:10,878 --> 00:54:12,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But so our clients don't either.

707
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:17,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So the gift, part of the gift and the beauty in coaching is simply in being present and

708
00:54:18,126 --> 00:54:26,909
[SPEAKER_03]: and reflecting back what people are saying so they can hear what they've just said and then go, that actually doesn't quite make sense.

709
00:54:28,189 --> 00:54:31,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think at one point I'd have to go back and look it up.

710
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:36,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Travis said, well, when you put it that way, you know, and then he shifted his thinking a little bit.

711
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:38,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was earlier on in the conversation.

712
00:54:39,913 --> 00:54:47,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, what was really beautifully modeled by you, Rosa, in your proficiency and competency and coaching and your knowledge and experience

713
00:54:47,802 --> 00:54:51,265
[SPEAKER_03]: was that the client does the work, the client does the work, the client does the work.

714
00:54:51,785 --> 00:54:55,108
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're working too hard, you're not coaching and you were coaching the whole time.

715
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you for that.

716
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so beautifully, just so much demonstrated.

717
00:55:00,652 --> 00:55:01,253
[SPEAKER_03]: How am I doing?

718
00:55:01,293 --> 00:55:03,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking really fast because I want to sit a lot.

719
00:55:05,236 --> 00:55:06,096
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you, Lorraine.

720
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:12,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that came to mind as you were talking, hopefully we're staying on time, is that place of...

721
00:55:13,562 --> 00:55:16,043
[SPEAKER_00]: spending the time at the beginning to say like, what's important to you?

722
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,123
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to walk away with?

723
00:55:17,623 --> 00:55:24,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it allows you as the coach to, as a person's processing, I'm an external processor.

724
00:55:24,746 --> 00:55:26,487
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk and talk and talk and process.

725
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:30,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, I heard when Travis was like, okay, I'm lost.

726
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to be like, yeah, don't worry.

727
00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:37,013
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the notes of where you started and I'm going to bring you back to where you started and like, let's go that way.

728
00:55:37,413 --> 00:55:40,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's so important to spend the time to say, what is it?

729
00:55:40,735 --> 00:55:42,177
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to get out of the conversation?

730
00:55:42,237 --> 00:55:43,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that important?

731
00:55:43,497 --> 00:55:46,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as a coach, you can say, okay, where did we meander?

732
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.

733
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold the process.

734
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:51,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back and say, how are we doing against that goal?

735
00:55:51,664 --> 00:55:52,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it need to shift?

736
00:55:52,944 --> 00:55:53,965
[SPEAKER_00]: How far are we going?

737
00:55:54,305 --> 00:55:56,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in that 12 minutes, it allowed, it's like an anchor.

738
00:55:56,627 --> 00:55:57,568
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of back to that

739
00:55:57,928 --> 00:56:00,169
[SPEAKER_00]: it's spend the time because it becomes an anchor.

740
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:03,991
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes your life easier, easier to go with the flow.

741
00:56:04,891 --> 00:56:05,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

742
00:56:05,312 --> 00:56:14,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to, to build on that, because that was evidenced and demonstrated so well in this coaching is the competency of establishing the coaching agreement, which is what you're referring to.

743
00:56:14,756 --> 00:56:19,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not just establishing it, spending the time there, it's maintaining it, right.

744
00:56:19,138 --> 00:56:21,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Establishes and maintains the agreement.

745
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:24,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had that opportunity to come back to that place.

746
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,182
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have to flounder and, oh, you're lost.

747
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:27,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, let me fix it for you.

748
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:33,889
[SPEAKER_03]: You were able to stay in your coaching presence because you could go and say, oh, yeah, remember this agreement that we had at the beginning?

749
00:56:34,249 --> 00:56:37,792
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you wanted to get this just so beautifully demonstrated.

750
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:41,155
[SPEAKER_03]: You're beautiful and such a powerful, profound coach.

751
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And Travis, I wish you well in your meeting.

752
00:56:43,464 --> 00:56:44,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we all do.

753
00:56:44,445 --> 00:56:46,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Travis.

754
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:52,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, Travis, as well for being willing to do this.

755
00:56:53,414 --> 00:56:55,416
[SPEAKER_02]: We really, really, really appreciate it.

756
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's providing so much value to others.

757
00:56:57,618 --> 00:57:01,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and Rosa, you rock, as well as as Loray.

758
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:06,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thank you all so much for supporting this.

759
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:15,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to segue into a few things as we've just got a few minutes left.

760
00:57:16,212 --> 00:57:18,714
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again, thank you all so much.

761
00:57:19,514 --> 00:57:25,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to just mention, you've all witnessed this.

762
00:57:26,457 --> 00:57:31,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I always say, what if everyone had coaching skills?

763
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:38,739
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I'm a passionate advocate for this, because what if we had more conversations like this?

764
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,340
[SPEAKER_02]: What if that was the case?

765
00:57:40,941 --> 00:57:46,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that note, we have a whole variety of people who are here on this webinar today.
