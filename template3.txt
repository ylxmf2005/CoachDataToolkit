{raw_transcription}
The above is a transcription of a psychological coaching video. 

In this video transcription, the coach, coachee, and a third-party marker are watching a coaching conversation video between the coach and the coachee. 

During this process, they pause the coaching conversation video between coach and coachee and insert their comments/evaluations/explanations/feelings at any time.

Your task is to label the speakers as:

1. Coach: The coach speaking directly to the coachee during the coaching conversation. 
2. Coachee: The coachee speaking directly to the coach during the coaching conversation.
3. Marker (Coach): The coach comments or evaluates the coaching process. If the coach are commenting/reviewing (not speaking during the coaching conversation), make sure to label him as Marker (Coach) instead of Coach.
4. Marker (Coachee): The coachee comments or evaluates the coaching process. 
5. Marker (Third-party): A third-party marker comments or evaluates the coaching process.

Typically, at least two markers (Coach, Coachee, or Third-party) will engage together in discussion and commentary, rather than just one marker commenting.

It is already known that the proportions of Marker(Coach) and Marker(Coachee) will be very high, and they usually appear consecutively. When it is uncertain whether to choose Coach/Marker(Coach) or Coachee/Marker(Coachee), please select the label with (Marker) (e.g., Marker(Coachee)).

2. Coachee: Yeah. [Coachee]

3. Coachee: So I've been thinking about this, thinking about what I would love to explore. [Coachee]

4. Coachee: And I think what I would like to dive into is. [Coachee]

5. Coachee: Figuring out how to balance like doing what's best for myself while also, um, supporting others in my life. [Coachee]

6. Coachee: Uh, I feel like I have a lot of dreams and passions that I'm working towards, but also see opportunities where I can step in and support others who are working on their dreams and passions. [Coachee]

7. Coachee: Um, and trying to make sure that like, I'm balanced in that, like I'm not only focused on myself. [Coachee]

8. Coachee: but I'm also like lending a helping hand and being a friend and a support to others, if that makes sense. [Coachee]

9. Coach: It does, yeah, I see. [Coach]

10. Coach: Just have to get it out of the way. [Coach]

13. Coach: Right from the get-go. [Marker (Coach)]

14. Coachee: I thought it was great. [Marker (Coachee)]

15. Coachee: I thought it was a really great question. [Marker (Coachee)]

16. Coachee: I think I say that in the video. [Marker (Coachee)]

17. Coachee: I need a second to process what you said, but it was really good. [Marker (Coachee)]

18. Coach: To serve my resting coach face is not the best. [Marker (Coach)]

20. Coach: I don't know. [Marker (Coach)]

21. Coach: I always find it interesting. [Marker (Coach)]

22. Coach: I like that question a lot. [Marker (Coach)]

23. Coach: We'll see how it goes. [Marker (Coach)]

24. Coachee: I don't think they are. [Coachee]

25. Coach: What's still overlapping? [Coach]

28. Coachee: I don't have all the focus or the energy, and I have to be careful about what I commit to or say yes to, um. [Coachee]

Typically, after the marker, all previous coaches of the coachee can be designated as "Marker (Coach)." This applies to all coaches before the marker as well. For example:

Example Output2:
```
0. Coach: I'm not sure, but let's keep it going. [Marker (Coach)]

1. Marker: Okay. [Makrer (Third-party)]

2. Marker: All right. [Makrer (Third-party)]

3. Coach: I think I started this question with is, which is interesting to me, but we got to the clarity point. [Marker (Coach)]

4. Coach: So we'll see where we're at. [Marker (Coach)]

6. Coachee: But I think just clarity. [Coachee]

7. Coachee: I think you're taking a science question... [Coachee]

8. Coachee: And we could dive a little deeper. [Coachee]
