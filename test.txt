0. Coach: Antoine, any initial thoughts, comments, questions, yeah, ideas as we get launched into this space? [Coach]

1. Coachee: No, I'm just pretty curious about, you know, [Coachee]

2. Coachee: what we reveal through reviewing it. [Coachee]

3. Coachee: And, um, uh, it was a pleasure doing it, uh, additional demonstration. [Coachee]

4. Coachee: So excited to see what we could pull out as well. [Coachee]

5. Coach: And as we, before we jump into this, I'm just really curious just for myself and also just to get it there. [Coach]

6. Coach: What was, what was the effect of the after of the session? [Coach]

7. Coach: Like what I can sharpen the question, like, what did you, what action step or what did you find was different after the session happened? [Coach]

8. Coachee: That's a good question. [Coachee]

9. Coachee: I really started going for corporate contracts. [Coachee]

10. Coachee: I started talking to my friends who are in the tech world and seeing [Coachee]

11. Coachee: if their companies would be interested, and lo and behold, they were. [Coachee]

12. Coachee: So I already had several leads, and just still computed, still coming up with a plan around that, but, so I got the ball rolling. [Coachee]

13. Coach: Got the ball rolling. [Coach]

14. Coach: Good. [Coach]

15. Coach: Let's do it. [Coach]

16. Coach: Let me get the transcript also queued up. [Coach]

17. Coach: I have this ready to go. [Coach]

18. Coach: Here we go. [Coach]

19. Coach: I'm just going to jump in from the beginning, get to the time model right away, and then see, there are a couple of spots I really want to touch base on. [Coach]

20. Coach: And I'm so thankful that you're here and doing this. [Coach]

21. Coach: Let's jump in. [Coach]

22. Coach: So just really quick, where are you in the world? [Coach]

23. Coach: What focus, like where are you at in the training? [Coach]

24. Coach: And then what's your focus? [Coach]

25. Coach: And let's dive into it real quick. [Coach]

26. Coach: All right. [Coach]

27. Coach: I'm going to jump into... [Coach]

28. Coach: Uh, we jumped in really quickly. [Marker (Coach)]

29. Coach: Um, here, let's just jump within just a minute ahead. [Coach]

30. Coach: I'm gonna try to get through the whole thing in one sitting here. [Coach]

31. Coach: So successful. [Coach]

32. Coach: What would be the measurable outcome that you'd get from it? [Coach]

33. Coachee: Um, I really want to say my rate is two 50, 300. [Coachee]

34. Coachee: Um, and. [Coachee]

35. Coachee: I want to say that with, I like half believe it right now. [Coachee]

36. Coachee: I want to say that with all beliefs. [Coachee]

37. Coach: Okay. [Coach]

38. Coach: Okay. [Coach]

39. Coach: And then, uh, why is this important? [Coach]

40. Coachee: Um, just because, um, yeah, I just have a lot of things on my plate lately that require money. [Coachee]

41. Coachee: And, um, [Coachee]

42. Coachee: I believe I've grown a lot since I said my original rate and I've never changed it. [Coachee]

43. Coachee: Um, and I don't know how to, like, I've looked at other coaches and see other races. [Coachee]

44. Coachee: I was like, I think I'm around this ballpark. [Coachee]

45. Coachee: So, um, from what I saw, no. [Coachee]

46. Coach: So what's stopping you from any initial thoughts, Antoine looking at. [Coach]

47. Coach: it's so funny how much I move you can see like the discomfort in my body when I was saying that I wanted there's a tentativeness there too and it's also a somewhat it's odd because the words I feel like are confident like I want to be able to charge 300 250 300 to session [Marker (Coach)]

48. Coach: But the body language doesn't match. [Marker (Coach)]

49. Coach: But yet, I also think it doesn't not not match totally either. [Marker (Coach)]

50. Coach: You know what I mean? [Marker (Coach)]

51. Coach: Yeah, it's interesting. [Marker (Coach)]

52. Coach: I like this next question I go with. [Marker (Coach)]

53. Coach: I'm curious the impact of it. [Marker (Coach)]

54. Coach: I'm just doing it now. [Marker (Coach)]

55. Coach: Just saying. [Marker (Coach)]

56. Coach: I charge two... [Coach]

57. Coach: Let me go back 10 seconds. [Coach]

58. Coach: Here we go. [Coach]

59. Coachee: I've looked at other coaches and see other races. [Coachee]

60. Coachee: I was like, I think I'm not around this ballpark. [Coachee]

61. Coachee: So from what I saw, no. [Coachee]

62. Coach: So what's stopping you from just doing it now? [Coach]

63. Coach: Just saying I charged 250. [Coach]

64. Coachee: I think it's maybe fear of rejection, maybe fear of [Coachee]

65. Coachee: Am I actually worth that? [Coachee]

66. Coachee: Or am I giving enough value to that? [Coachee]

67. Coach: Okay. [Coach]

68. Coach: What's the... When you sit with this question, and you sit with it and not move it around, [Coach]

69. Coach: What do you notice physically? [Coach]

70. Coach: Wow. [Marker (Coach)]

71. Coach: That takes so long. [Marker (Coach)]

72. Coach: Are you kidding me? [Marker (Coach)]

73. Coach: That's like a 30-second question. [Marker (Coach)]

74. Coach: What's that, Aaron? [Marker (Coach)]

75. Coach: I'll get it for you in a little bit. [Marker (Coach)]

76. Coach: What's that like as a client? [Marker (Coach)]

77. Coachee: I definitely notice that. [Marker (Coachee)]

78. Coachee: I was like, wow, he puts a lot of space around this. [Marker (Coachee)]

79. Coachee: It definitely... [Marker (Coachee)]

80. Coachee: it has me gives me room to spin a bit not spin in a bad way like spin my wheels further my thinking or deepen my thinking [Marker (Coachee)]

81. Coach: Yeah, I realize I do this on purpose, not completely on purpose, but I'm not not doing it in the sense of I'm not really sure where to go with this right now as a coach. [Marker (Coach)]

82. Coach: You know, there's a couple of spots I'm thinking, OK, so I'm really it's like a it's like a water with like a bowl of water with sand in it. [Marker (Coach)]

83. Coach: And it feels like it's all swirly. [Marker (Coach)]

84. Coach: I'm just waiting for the sand to to settle. [Marker (Coach)]

85. Coach: Yeah. [Marker (Coach)]

86. Coach: And trying to figure out where is this at? [Marker (Coach)]

87. Coach: Like how much do I believe you as a client? [Marker (Coach)]

88. Coach: Like this is something that you're really wrestling with or is there something underneath it that I feel like, so I'm aligning with you. [Marker (Coach)]

89. Coach: I'm feeling your energy and feeling what's interesting. [Marker (Coach)]

90. Coach: Is it congruent, not congruent? [Marker (Coach)]

91. Coach: So far it feels pretty congruent still to me. [Marker (Coach)]

92. Coach: But that's also the question of what's stopping you right now from just saying it. [Marker (Coach)]

93. Coach: I'm sort of doing a congruence test, one. [Marker (Coach)]

94. Coach: And two, I'm slowing this way down on purpose. [Marker (Coach)]

95. Coach: Because I'm giving you space to exactly do what you're doing. [Marker (Coach)]

96. Coach: But sometimes I wonder, is it too much? [Marker (Coach)]

97. Coachee: I think it's good for me because I've been practicing slowing down. [Marker (Coachee)]

98. Coachee: I'm the type of, to fill my plate, then get a second plate. [Marker (Coachee)]

99. Coachee: So I think, specifically for me, it's like, I want to run to do the next thing, but this, it's like, no, we're going to sit with this and think about it. [Marker (Coachee)]

100. Coach: Yeah, I felt that too. [Marker (Coach)]

101. Coach: Felt that too. [Marker (Coach)]

102. Coach: All right, let's see how that lands. [Marker (Coach)]

103. Coach: Let's see how that lands. [Marker (Coach)]

104. Coachee: I kind of feel I feel I feel like it's I feel nervous I feel something in my stomach that's what I'm trying to feel right now yeah yeah [Coachee]

105. Coachee: I don't know what it really is. [Coachee]

106. Coachee: It's maybe almost like the slightest feeling of, I have a fear of heights. [Coachee]

107. Coachee: And like, if the edge is like just 10 feet away from me, like I know the height, the fall is right there, but I'm like comfortable right there, but I can still, I feel near it. [Coachee]

108. Coach: Okay. [Coach]

109. Coach: Okay. [Coach]

110. Coach: What happens if you take one step towards it? [Coach]

111. Coach: Increase the uncomfort just a little bit. [Coach]

112. Coach: You know, I cannot help it. [Marker (Coach)]

113. Coach: It's like, all right, you gave a metaphor, you gave space, you gave all the things. [Marker (Coach)]

114. Coach: You know, it's like as a coach, it's brilliant. [Marker (Coach)]

115. Coach: Like as a client, this is very generous clienting right now. [Marker (Coach)]

116. Coach: you know, did you, when I, when you were saying this out loud, did you know that I was going to say, okay, like, let's go, like, let's take a step towards it to increase it. [Marker (Coach)]

117. Coachee: Probably. [Marker (Coachee)]

118. Coachee: Yeah. [Marker (Coachee)]

119. Coachee: Just like, you know, then, and then we'll coaching yourself as a coach. [Marker (Coachee)]

120. Coachee: I felt that question coming. [Marker (Coachee)]

121. Coach: Yeah. [Marker (Coach)]

122. Coach: Yeah. [Marker (Coach)]

123. Coach: Yeah. [Marker (Coach)]

124. Coach: I mean, and also we have to understand like the, the setup for this is somewhat, you know, it's, it's known like, you know, you're, we're recording this. [Marker (Coach)]

125. Coach: We know we're going to be doing this afterwards. [Marker (Coach)]

126. Coach: And at the same time, I'm trying to hit different exercises that we do in the training that need coaching demos. [Marker (Coach)]

127. Coach: So there's a lot of stuff like percolating through a metaphor like this. [Marker (Coach)]

128. Coach: I mean, as a coach, it's almost like, yeah, just go with that metaphor. [Marker (Coach)]

129. Coach: We could have gone through this the whole session, but I think we let it go after pretty quickly after this, but let's see what happens. [Marker (Coach)]

130. Coachee: And like the tingles start to happen. [Coachee]

131. Coachee: Like the fear of falling off really starts to grow. [Coachee]

132. Coachee: Yeah. [Coachee]

133. Coach: Let's go for it. [Coach]

134. Coach: So we get clarity around [Coach]

135. Coach: your perspective, your comfort level with your price and the value you're putting on your time. [Coach]

136. Coach: Is that the focus for today? [Coach]

137. Coach: Yeah, sounds perfect. [Coach]

138. Coach: Let's do it. [Coach]

139. Coach: Let's do it. [Coach]

140. Coach: Okay. [Coach]

141. Coach: Let's go first into an assumption chart. [Coach]

142. Coach: So that finishes the echo, the time model, the topic, the importance, the measurement, and then the echo. [Coach]

143. Coach: How long was that? [Coach]

144. Coach: Four and a half minutes? [Coach]

145. Coach: That's pretty good. [Coach]

146. Coach: It's about right for a 30-minute session. [Coach]

147. Coach: Yeah. [Coach]

148. Coach: Does that get there? [Coach]

149. Coach: Is that enough? [Coach]

150. Coach: Yeah. [Coach]

151. Coachee: I mean, it's... [Marker (Coachee)]

152. Coachee: curious to me to like how much honestly I put like maybe a minute or two even in my hour long sessions I'm like let's get it let's get this and go with it but it's you put a lot of space and attention around but for sure a really like maybe my maybe my time model is like [Marker (Coachee)]

153. Coachee: very general, like in the neighborhood, but you get the exact location, it feels like. [Marker (Coachee)]

154. Coach: Yeah, and I think it's okay too. [Marker (Coach)]

155. Coach: You know what I mean? [Marker (Coach)]

156. Coach: Like when you do time models and you're trying to figure out, okay, like I think we're close. [Marker (Coach)]

157. Coach: I think it's enough to get to a... [Marker (Coach)]

158. Coach: how do I say it? [Marker (Coach)]

159. Coach: It's enough to get close because even here, I'm not a hundred percent sure. [Marker (Coach)]

160. Coach: Well, yeah, I'm sure this is the topic. [Marker (Coach)]

161. Coach: Like, you know what I mean? [Marker (Coach)]

162. Coach: Like we just got one, you got feels, you got a metaphor going. [Marker (Coach)]

163. Coach: I'm like, I'm thinking of myself. [Marker (Coach)]

164. Coach: Oh yeah. [Marker (Coach)]

165. Coach: Like, like it's good, you know? [Marker (Coach)]

166. Coach: Um, [Coach]

167. Coach: I just did a demo last week, which we'll look at, where I think I waited like 20 minutes in a 40-minute session to get the time model. [Marker (Coach)]

168. Coach: Like, it just was a slow step. [Marker (Coach)]

169. Coach: And by time, it was like, yeah, topic, importance, measurement, and echo. [Marker (Coach)]

170. Coach: But I think there's also benefit too, to going through it rather quickly. [Marker (Coach)]

171. Coach: A lot of it depends on your clients too. [Marker (Coach)]

172. Coach: Like if you've trained your clients to go through it quickly, that they know it's coming, they know what to expect, they jump in right away. [Marker (Coach)]

173. Coach: It's all good. [Marker (Coach)]

174. Coach: All right, let's keep it going. [Marker (Coach)]

175. Coach: It's amazing how much you can break down a four minutes, four and a half minutes video. [Marker (Coach)]

176. Coach: Right. [Marker (Coach)]

177. Coach: To the negative, all the negative assumptions first, and we'll switch over to the positive. [Coach]

178. Coach: What are the things, let's say your inner critic are some of the most [Coach]

179. Marker (Third-party): heavy things that you're saying to yourself and we go right to some of the assumptions you're making yeah um so the assumptions i'm making here like i feel like i have to go to the corporate world to ask for this kind of money um i feel like in order to get there i have to ask my friends and i have a fear of like [Marker (Third-party)]

180. Coachee: looking weak in front of them asking for help um in this way um i have a cheer or assuming people will say no um yeah that's it [Coachee]

181. Coach: What perspective do those assumptions naturally want to lead to? [Coach]

182. Coach: I'm not sure how much I, as a coach, I believe where you're going from it, but I'm not sure how. [Marker (Coach)]

183. Coach: I feel like there's something else here. [Marker (Coach)]

184. Coach: If I'm listening to yourself, what are your thoughts in this session? [Marker (Coach)]

185. Coachee: I believe, though, I mean, that's definitely true about, like, [Coachee]

186. Coachee: fear of looking weak in front of friends um but like what i did to like i did ask my friends and they did they didn't say no i'm um they said yes um i'm [Coachee]

187. Coachee: um, they said yes um i'm um, i just attacked a few i was like all right i'm just gonna take a swing at it and see what happens um [Coachee]

188. Coachee: So, and as I was saying this, I don't think I'm quite sure why I'm so resistant as well. [Coachee]

189. Coachee: I knew like that is part of the resistance, but not the whole picture. [Coachee]

190. Coach: Yeah, I felt that too. [Marker (Coach)]

191. Coach: I felt like this, I mean, it's interesting to feel like, okay, it's enough for us to keep going with this session. [Marker (Coach)]

192. Coach: Like, okay, this is useful. [Marker (Coach)]

193. Coach: And I felt like I was waiting for another topic to drop. [Marker (Coach)]

194. Coach: where it's like, oh, I do this in this other area of my life, or this comes up here and there. [Marker (Coach)]

195. Coach: Yeah, I was just really curious about it. [Marker (Coach)]

196. Coach: And I know we're using the assumption chart, which I think fits. [Marker (Coach)]

197. Coach: I mean, this one works well enough. [Marker (Coach)]

198. Coach: And so I'm trusting the process at this point that if there is a deeper agenda that wants to come out, it will. [Marker (Coach)]

199. Coach: I'm not going to try to poke too hard yet. [Marker (Coach)]

200. Coach: I swear I'm out with that. [Marker (Coach)]

201. Coach: Yeah, let's keep it going. [Marker (Coach)]

202. Coach: Let's keep it going. [Marker (Coach)]

203. Coach: I love this pause, by the way. [Marker (Coach)]

204. Coachee: People are going to say no. [Coachee]

205. Yeah. [Marker (Third-party)]

206. Coach: People say no. [Coach]

207. Coach: How does that evidence feed back into the assumptions and the fear? [Coach]

208. Coachee: How does that feed back into it? [Coachee]

209. Coachee: Like they were right? [Coachee]

210. Coachee: Or like, you know, you're dreaming too big? [Coachee]

211. Coachee: Or what makes you think you're worth that? [Coachee]

212. Coachee: I don't know. [Coachee]

213. Coachee: Yeah. [Coachee]

214. Coachee: I often feel like here it is I am doing I do I definitely would say my past is ambitious and a lot of my decisions have been ambitious and um but I've made them work but I'm always faced with like are you sure you're gonna do this um yeah [Coachee]

215. Coach: What have you learned about yourself within that process? [Coach]

216. Coachee: Like always kind of most of the time come up on top. [Coachee]

217. Coachee: Like I've actually now that I think of it, a lot of this, those feelings where I'm like taking a big bite out of life. [Coachee]

218. Coachee: I felt like this, like, am I really sure I should be doing this or. [Coachee]

219. Coachee: But kind of just, you know, jump in anyway, like jumping off the cliff anyway. [Coachee]

220. Coachee: And then. [Coachee]

221. Coach: They've worked out. [Coach]

222. Coach: Yeah. [Coach]

223. Coach: Yeah, it's a negative assumption. [Coach]

224. Coach: They can. [Coach]

225. Coachee: I mean, that feeling still remains true, but now it's... I'm like, I've jumped now. [Coachee]

226. Coachee: And I'm still wondering about the parachute because a lot of it is still in slugs, but I'm proud that I've jumped. [Coachee]

227. Coachee: And it seems... [Coachee]

228. Coachee: At least I have the cord in hand. [Coachee]

229. Coachee: There are fruits budding, but I feel like until I get the contract or I get a firm yes from somebody, or maybe honestly enough no's, that I'm like, oh, this is still, I'm fine. [Coachee]

230. Coachee: I'm still here doing the same thing, but at least I've adventured [Coachee]

231. Coach: Right. [Coach]

232. Coach: Yeah. [Coach]

233. Coach: I feel like we've hit, at this point here for me as a coach, it clicked where it felt to me like feeling into this where I thought, wow, this is instead of, instead of being something that we need to actively push away from, this is part of your creative process and it works for you. [Marker (Coach)]

234. Coach: So it's almost like this, it's like a perceived problem, but it's actually, I mean, I speak to it in the session, but for me at this point, this is when it clicked and I realized, wait a second, in my mind, the deeper agenda here isn't, okay, getting 250, 300 clients, sure, that's fine. [Marker (Coach)]

235. Coach: But the bigger thing for me is you have so much talent. [Marker (Coach)]

236. Coach: You have so much confidence in your ability to make some hard things happen [Marker (Coach)]

237. Coach: I get the fear of being so big. [Marker (Coach)]

238. Coach: What's really holding you back from being big? [Marker (Coach)]

239. Coachee: Are you answering that now? [Marker (Coachee)]

240. Coach: I mean, that's kind of... I mean, yes. [Marker (Coach)]

241. Coachee: I think... I've been told... [Coachee]

242. Coachee: many of times that like, basically like, who do you think you are? [Coachee]

243. Coachee: He's like, I believe I can do this thing. [Coachee]

244. Coachee: And my peers in the past have said like, you're not that guy. [Coachee]

245. Coachee: You're like, you're not. [Coachee]

246. Coachee: You're not great at Frisbee. [Coachee]

247. Coachee: You can't do your own business. [Coachee]

248. Coachee: No one has done that. [Coachee]

249. Coachee: To travel the world based on your services, no one has done that. [Coachee]

250. Coachee: But I just had a deeper feeling of, I just think I can do it, though. [Coachee]

251. Coachee: I might be the first one to do it, but I still think I can do it. [Coachee]

252. Coachee: But then when I look out into the world, I'm like, oh, several, if not more, people have done this. [Coachee]

253. Coach: Yeah, I mean, there's something I read. [Marker (Coach)]

254. Coach: I forget where it was. [Marker (Coach)]

255. Coach: It was your dream, like living your dream will never be as good as you believe it will be, nor living your fear will never be as bad as you think it will be. [Marker (Coach)]

256. Coach: I don't know how much I believe that or not, but it's just an interesting thing to play with, this idea of... I mean, sometimes I think our dreams, living dreams, surprise us. [Marker (Coach)]

257. Coach: They're way better than we ever thought it could be. [Marker (Coach)]

258. Coach: And other times I get it. [Marker (Coach)]

259. Coach: It's like, oh, I thought this one business thing was going to work out. [Marker (Coach)]

260. Coach: It's okay. [Marker (Coach)]

261. Coach: It's like, you know, meh. [Marker (Coach)]

262. Coach: I'm positive. [Marker (Coach)]

263. Coach: I'm still glad it happened, but I'm not like over the moon, like, oh my goodness, it was the thing that's going to save the next three decades. [Marker (Coach)]

264. Coach: I feel like there's a little bit of that here, but I mean, my overwhelming feeling at this point is as a coach is this is a useful process. [Marker (Coach)]

265. Coach: I don't want to destroy it. [Marker (Coach)]

266. Coach: It's almost like, how can we build this into your, like, how can we codify it in, in, into like, make it Canon for you? [Marker (Coach)]

267. Coach: Like, this is just a spot, like a milestone in this space, not necessarily even a spot to even be avoided. [Marker (Coach)]

268. Coachee: Yeah. [Marker (Coachee)]

269. Coachee: Yeah. [Marker (Coachee)]

270. Coach: Yeah. [Marker (Coach)]

271. Coach: What are we in? [Marker (Coach)]

272. Coach: We're at minute mark 815. [Marker (Coach)]

273. Coach: And I feel like it clicked for me. [Marker (Coach)]

274. Coach: And we'll see how I use that insight, this question. [Marker (Coach)]

275. Coach: It feels like part of a larger process that works for you. [Marker (Coach)]

276. Coachee: Look at your face. [Marker (Coachee)]

277. Coach: It feels like, how is this one step along? [Marker (Coach)]

278. Coach: You know what I mean? [Marker (Coach)]

279. Coach: Oh, we're at this train stop. [Marker (Coach)]

280. Coach: And now the next stop is what? [Marker (Coach)]

281. Coachee: You know? [Marker (Coachee)]

282. Coachee: Yeah. [Marker (Coachee)]

283. Coachee: Um, what is the next step? [Marker (Coachee)]

284. Coachee: Um, I never thought of it that way. [Marker (Coachee)]

285. Coachee: Um, that really like testing the waters, like, you know, you don't have to jump. [Marker (Coachee)]

286. Coachee: You can like throw a rock. [Marker (Coachee)]

287. Coach: So how many of you throw a rock here? [Marker (Coach)]

288. Coachee: I mean I can like just ask a friend that I know what's it that has been helping me wants to help me and I can just ask to like get the ball rolling kind of shake off the fear a bit yeah mm-hmm mm-hmm [Marker (Coachee)]

289. Coach: Let's shift to the positive one, positive assumption cycle on this. [Coach]

290. Coach: Let's say we were to flip almost those negative assumptions almost completely on its head where this is like a strategic advantage. [Coach]

291. Coach: What does assumptions mean? [Coach]

292. Coach: I really like this question. [Marker (Coach)]

293. Coach: curious as a client, I know that transition was abrupt. [Marker (Coach)]

294. Coach: I'm also trying to work in a, in exercise, you know, the negative assumption chart and the positive assumption chart and work them in pretty quick. [Marker (Coach)]

295. Coach: Cause I know we have short time, even in this session, what was that transition like as a client? [Marker (Coach)]

296. Coachee: Um, I didn't feel that abrupt to me. [Marker (Coachee)]

297. Coachee: I feel like [Marker (Coachee)]

298. Coachee: In general, when I get coached, I feel like I come to conclusions pretty quickly, maybe too quickly, but I feel like I satisfied like, yes, these assumptions are producing like these actions and it's like freezing me. [Marker (Coachee)]

299. Coachee: I'm thinking it's a problem, but maybe I'm just assuming it's a problem. [Marker (Coachee)]

300. Coach: That's cool. [Marker (Coach)]

301. Coach: I know that as a coach, I feel like I'm super connected. [Marker (Coach)]

302. Coach: You're being a really generous client. [Marker (Coach)]

303. Coach: You're in the space. [Marker (Coach)]

304. Coach: The metaphor of jumping has come up maybe five or six times at this point. [Marker (Coach)]

305. Coach: We have a lot of tangibility to the ideas. [Marker (Coach)]

306. Coach: They keep me throwing a rock. [Marker (Coach)]

307. Coach: taking a step closer. [Marker (Coach)]

308. Coach: I mean, I feel like we're definitely in this space. [Marker (Coach)]

309. Coach: This to me feels like, yeah, I'm making a transition going to it. [Marker (Coach)]

310. Coach: Let's just get a little bit more, and then I think that's our time. [Marker (Coach)]

311. Coach: We might have to shift these coaching and flourish to be an hour to get through a 30-minute session, or we might just do part two next week and just rinse and repeat. [Marker (Coach)]

312. Coach: Let's get just a little bit more [Marker (Coach)]

313. Coach: And then we'll pause it and we'll have to put a pin in it. [Marker (Coach)]

314. Coach: And then, yeah, let's maybe look at next week. [Marker (Coach)]

315. Coach: Maybe not. [Marker (Coach)]

316. Coach: I don't know. [Marker (Coach)]

317. Coach: Let's see where we're at. [Marker (Coach)]

318. Coach: Sounds good. [Marker (Coach)]

319. Coachee: This is an advantage to have this fear. [Marker (Coachee)]

320. Coach: Maybe. [Marker (Coach)]

321. Coach: Or like, let's even shift the fear. [Marker (Coach)]

322. Coach: Let's shift the fear to excitement. [Marker (Coach)]

323. Coach: What happens? [Marker (Coach)]

324. Coach: I'm really pushing for positive on this. [Marker (Coach)]

325. Coach: Like, I'm pushing you. [Marker (Coach)]

326. Coach: I mean, I meant, yeah, the fear is a spot on this, but I want to push the fear even to excitement to see how far I can push it as a coach at this point. [Marker (Coach)]

327. Coach: Let's see how you take it. [Marker (Coach)]

328. Coach: There you go. [Marker (Coach)]

329. Coachee: Yeah. [Marker (Coachee)]

330. Coachee: That's a... I want to say dangerous. [Marker (Coachee)]

331. Coachee: I did a... [Marker (Coachee)]

332. Coachee: I feel like I'm impulsive sometimes. [Marker (Coachee)]

333. Coachee: And I like just jump without looking and maybe get to some trouble because I jump without looking. [Marker (Coachee)]

334. Coachee: But we are talking about the present. [Marker (Coachee)]

335. Coach: Oh, you got to stop here. [Marker (Coach)]

336. Coach: Oh, it's so good. [Marker (Coach)]

337. Coach: Oh, there's so much to unpack in that. [Marker (Coach)]

338. Coach: Isn't that amazing? [Marker (Coach)]

339. Coach: As a coach, I went, so I found the boundary. [Marker (Coach)]

340. Coach: I found the boundary line. [Marker (Coach)]

341. Coach: Yeah, it's a client. [Marker (Coach)]

342. Coach: What are your thoughts? [Marker (Coach)]

343. Coachee: I mean, yeah, it was, I think this moment was like, at least for me, it was, [Marker (Coachee)]

344. Coachee: doing my process as a tool and not like a detriment that I've like often found myself like the hole I always fall into was like oh no it's this this gulping feel when you see the cliff but now I'm more viewing it as like oh this is what the next level is um like this is [Marker (Coachee)]

345. Coachee: you view it as maybe from the other way, viewing the cliff as the wall. [Marker (Coachee)]

346. Coachee: And to get there, you have to start climbing. [Marker (Coachee)]

347. Coach: At this point, I felt like I found... [Marker (Coach)]

348. Coach: I felt like I entered into your mindset of, okay, yeah, it really is fear, but that fear is useful. [Marker (Coach)]

349. Coach: And it's not like you want to just dismiss the fear because then it becomes like a kid who just jumps on a bike. [Marker (Coach)]

350. Coach: And then there can be some real consequences. [Marker (Coach)]

351. Coach: But then I still wanted to push it and say, are you sure there's real consequences? [Marker (Coach)]

352. Coach: I'm sure there are, but you're still here. [Marker (Coach)]

353. Coach: You're still standing. [Marker (Coach)]

354. Coach: You're still doing amazing things. [Marker (Coach)]

355. Coach: You know? [Marker (Coach)]

356. Coach: Right, right, right. [Marker (Coach)]

357. Coachee: Yeah. [Marker (Coachee)]

358. Coachee: Yeah. [Marker (Coachee)]

359. Coachee: That is true. [Marker (Coachee)]

360. Coachee: You know, you're our biggest critic, but I think I'm also on this, like, I'm trying to unlearn, like, [Marker (Coachee)]

361. Coachee: I think at the beginning of my self-development journey after college or really pursuing it, I got into a trap of there's something wrong with me. [Marker (Coachee)]

362. Coachee: Let me try to fix it. [Marker (Coachee)]

363. Coachee: And I think that is coming up in here. [Marker (Coachee)]

364. Coachee: There's something wrong with me. [Marker (Coachee)]

365. Coachee: I don't know if I can do this because I have to find the answer or something. [Marker (Coachee)]

366. Coach: All right. [Coach]

367. Coach: All right. [Coach]

368. Coach: I think it's to some degree we're all conditioned that way with grades. [Marker (Coach)]

369. Coach: You have grades that deliver judgment that you can't change without. [Marker (Coach)]

370. Coach: I mean, it's not like you take a test and you can redo the test and get a different grade and move on. [Marker (Coach)]

371. Coach: Business is like that to some degree, but I find that business requires a completely different mindset because you can redo. [Marker (Coach)]

372. Coach: It takes time, energy, sure, but so does redoing anything. [Marker (Coach)]

373. Coach: But it's not like you're graded and then you can [Marker (Coach)]

374. Coach: never remake that money, you know what I mean? [Marker (Coach)]

375. Coach: Or remake the whatever deal you have to, whatever deal was lost. [Marker (Coach)]

376. Coach: It's amazing to feel you wrestling with that necessary shift in this space. [Marker (Coach)]

377. Coach: And also to honor the pit stop of, yeah, let's check in with the fear. [Marker (Coach)]

378. Coachee: Yeah, that really resonates with me. [Marker (Coachee)]

379. Coachee: I think especially this week, I was like, there's several clients I offered a package and they said no. [Marker (Coachee)]

380. Coachee: And I've been thinking of those as like, I think in the past of [Marker (Coachee)]

381. Coachee: Like, this is the only time I'm going to see this person. [Marker (Coachee)]

382. Coachee: So like, I must, it must be perfect. [Marker (Coachee)]

383. Coachee: I must do this. [Marker (Coachee)]

384. Coachee: I was like, no, like you built a good relationship with this person. [Marker (Coachee)]

385. Coachee: This is just like, not yet. [Marker (Coachee)]

386. Coachee: Not right now. [Marker (Coachee)]

387. Coachee: And also there's like a billion people in the world. [Marker (Coachee)]

388. Coachee: Like you, you get so many tries. [Marker (Coachee)]

389. Coachee: Um, at the end of the day, like I didn't ruin the relationship. [Marker (Coachee)]

390. Coachee: He just saying that right now. [Marker (Coachee)]

391. Coach: Yeah. [Coach]

392. Coach: I mean, there's, I have a lot of thoughts on marketing, you know, where we can get to that as, and I think we can go into it, you know, later on in this session. [Marker (Coach)]

393. Coach: But ideas around even taking a leap, putting yourself out there and you being successful matters on so many levels that [Marker (Coach)]

394. Coach: Yeah, it's an honor to be here in this space with you and to see you work through this with such generous clienting. [Marker (Coach)]

395. Coach: Yeah, thank you. [Marker (Coach)]

396. Coach: Thanks for doing this today. [Marker (Coach)]

397. Coach: And if we could maybe get the second half next week. [Marker (Coach)]

398. Coachee: Yeah. [Marker (Coachee)]

399. Coachee: I'd be glad to. [Marker (Coachee)]

400. Coachee: It was an honor to be in touch with you and to dissect the session. [Marker (Coachee)]

401. Coachee: Yeah, I got more thoughts on it, too. [Marker (Coachee)]

402. Coach: Thank you for watching, listening. [Marker (Third-party)]

403. Coach: Let us know if you're liking these demos, the coaching to flourish. [Marker (Third-party)]

404. Coach: You know, it feels vulnerable. [Marker (Third-party)]

405. Coach: You know, hey, this is our coaching. [Marker (Third-party)]

406. Coach: This is vulnerable clienting. [Marker (Third-party)]

407. Coach: But if you have any questions at all, send them our way. [Marker (Third-party)]

408. Coach: I love to get to them. [Marker (Third-party)]

409. Coach: And we'll have Antoine next week as well. [Marker (Third-party)]
